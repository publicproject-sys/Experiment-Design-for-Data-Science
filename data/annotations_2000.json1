{"id": 3, "text": "I suppose this review will be biased, because I went to this park on Mother's Day, which meant that a lot of people were taking their mothers out to brunch / lunch / etc., rather than spending it at a theme park.That meant the queues were minimal... I even rode Superman: Krypton, and was able to stay on the ride and go around again, because there was literally no one waiting to get on.The park did get busier later in the day, but as it was a hot day, most people were going to the water park.Like many theme parks, there's a bit of a lack of TRULY healthy options for dining, or a bit more variety other than burgers, fries and basically anything that isn't deep fried.But the rides here are great, and obviously well maintained.  If something isn't working properly, it's shut down - and that makes me feel safe.  It's why I never complain about a delayed aircraft due to mechanical reasons!The park entry fee is reasonable, and moreso if you're a local and can upgrade to a Season Pass.  I'd be there every day, if I could!I didn't get a chance to see any shows, but did pass one at some point during the day, in the open air auditorium - a country rock band / singers.  And they sounded really professional.  I was impressed.Of course, the best ride here is the Iron Rattler, which I probably rode about 8 times!  And again, the queues were minimal - pretty much straight on, unless you wanted to wait for the front row - which I did once.  So again, my review is biased because of the low wait times I had.  I don't think I'd be raving as much if I had to stand in queue for 2 hours or more, to ride something for about 60 seconds!A fun day out...", "meta": {"review_id": "g60956-d105060-r210143966", "category": "food"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[539, 578, "Exclusion"], [227, 246, "Inclusion"], [900, 928, "Inclusion"], [1336, 1355, "Inclusion"], [1493, 1514, "Inclusion"]]}

King Ludwig was perhaps mad, but how wonderful that millions of regular people can now enjoy his fantasies!You can only see the interior of Neuschwanstein Castle by taking a guided tour. The tour is fairly canned and straight-forward not super dynamic, and they keep you to a tight schedule, but you get to see amazing rooms that are otherwise inaccessible, so do it!Hohenschwangau is the village where you start your experience. It's located at the foot of the hill on which Neuschwanstein is perched, and has dining and shopping options while you wait for your appointed tour time. You can take a horse-drawn carriage up the hill to the castle, or a motorized shuttle during certain times of year. Or you can simply walk up.

{"id": 86, "text": "We traveled on the evening ferry which leaves at 7.30pm with 2 small kids and 2 dogs.  The tickets and website weren't very clear on the boarding process or time so I had to call. I'd heard all different stories from people about needing to be there from 5 and the problem of then having to wait in the car till 7.30. The lady I rang at the booking office suggested we get there at 6.15pm. Perfect! The queue wasn't too long and it didn't take more than an hour for us to board,  put the dogs in the kennel and get to our rooms. We feed the kids dinner while waiting in the car. As our kids are young and in bed by 7.30pm we booked two inside cabins next to each other so we could put the kids to bed and then later transfer one across to the other room with a parent in each room. The inside cabins are cheaper as you don't get a window what can you see at night at sea anyway?  but they are also larger. We didn't realize until morning that you can turn the PA volume down in the rooms. They seemed to page people a lot which made it hard to get the kids to sleep. As we had to eat in our room we looked for a take away food option. There isn't really much so we had a pie and lackey of patio crisps from one of the bars. We did hear latest that you could take a tray from the buffet restaurant to your room. We had a walk around the ferry before putting the kids down and the facilities looked good. I can imagine if you don't book a place to sleep then then the 10 hours would get quite expensive as you would be tempted to buy food and drink from the couple of bars which wasn't cheap. The restaurants looked okay but we didn't try them. The gift shop was very well stocked although a little overpriced considering many of the same products are all over Tassie at a cheaper price. The tourism information was well worth a visit and the staff are very knowlegable.It was a very rough night and the kids slept through it but we didn't get much sleep at all.  Speaking to others in the morning it appeared not many people got a good night's sleep. Not good if you intend to travel long distances the following day. Have done it once and was fun.

{"id": 88, "text": "Having used Brittany Ferries for the first time, this trip exceeded my expectations. As many who are reading this will know from countless other reviews, the 'Pont Aven' traveling to Santander suffered from a major fire, and as a result, sailings were canceled and rebooked in different areas and the journey was lengthened considerably. Despite this, the trip was excellent. Boarding:The process is always quite stressful, and lots of waiting is involved. Staff were friendly and directed us to the right places to load onto the ferry. Check-in was quick and security were excellent and very professional. We happened to be travelling with a dog, which means we were parked in a separate area so that the dogs could be taken to the kennels easily. Unfortunately, this meant that we were among the last to board, so bear that in mind when you start to queue for boarding as there is no point arriving super early just to be among the last to board! The process of boarding is not 'first come, first served'.Whilst coming onto the main decks of the ship, the staff were greeting us and were very helpful in directing to cabins etc. Accommodation:Our group stayed in a normal interior room and a Deluxe room. The interior room while basic was clean, with the beds comfortable. There were 2 outlets in the room which were sufficient for charging devices. The toilet, while small, is practical and the room doesn't get incredibly wet when someone takes a shower, which is always nice. The deluxe room was excellent. We were greeted with macarons and fresh fruit, the beds were incredibly comfortable with the room having a TV and coffee making facilities. The bathroom was good with a separate shower enclosure. If you book a deluxe room/commodore cabin, you also get access to the Commodore lounge, which gives excellent sea views, plenty of seating and complimentary drinks.  Both rooms had excellent air conditioning. Food:Whilst eating onboard, you don't have many options. I encourage you if you are traveling aboard the 'Pont Aven' that you book a table at the 'Le Flora' restaurant, which is the only fine dining restaurant on the ship. The menu is fixed price and consists of a buffet and set courses, both of which were excellent. 'Le Flora' is also open for breakfast and offers an excellent spread of food for a good price. If you choose not to eat at the fine dining restaurant you have 2 other choices. The main buffet-style restaurant, or a cafe selling snacks and drinks. I can't speak much for these two restaurants but they looked ok. Prices aren't going to be great since it's a ferry but it wasn't too ridiculous. Entertainment:There is a cinema onboard with decently priced tickets. They show recent films but be sure to book well in advance as tickets go very quickly! There is a small 'pool', which is more like a bathtub but it seemed to be busy. There are 3 bars and entertainment programs for young children. Apart from that, there isn't much to do. There is a large duty-free shop and they have areas for sunbathing. Do keep in mind though that the day passes quickly. Disembarkation:This was speedy and easy. We traveled to Santander and passport checks were quick, few vehicles were searched. Obviously, every experience is going to be different but it wasn't that stressful for us. I must mention a few things though which are vital if you are a first-time traveler onboard Brittany;Wifi service is offered onboard, with a premium and free wifi being offered. The 'free wifi' doesn't work at all, don't even bother connecting. The premium wifi is fast but incredibly expensive, so it is advised that you download whatever you need before you go. Dog cabins and kennel spots get booked up quickly, do not leave your booking to a later date, otherwise, all spots will go! While the tap water is safe to drink, it doesn't taste the best!

{"id": 95, "text": "My wife and I visited on a mid-Sunday afternoon in early December. There were very few people on the grounds. Even though we were charged the full $17.95 admission price each, several attractions and food and drink options were closed. We did have a late lunch at Big Jake's BBQ and were charged $27.50 for two BBQ sandwiches, two tablespoons of baked beans and two medium soft drinks. My shoes stuck to the floor from spilled soda in a couple places. The food was not worth the price. I've had better BBQ beef at fast food outlets. We ate off paper plates with plastic utensils and used paper towels for napkins. However, the biggest disappointment was that I expected more history and more about the movies and TV shows that have been filmed there; the buildings and grounds are pretty much devoid of anything that explains their historic significance. There is a small museum near the entrance, but it obviously hasn't been updated for many, many years; their list of movies and TV shows filmed at Old Tucson hasn't been updated since 1997. We did go to a couple of the live shows. They were entertaining but not what I came to see. What this is is a commercial attraction with very expensive food and drink and way overpriced souvenir and gift shops; in fact, you have to walk through a gift shop to leave the grounds so they get one last chance to sell you something. I was expecting a museum-like atmosphere. What I got was a theme park. If you are looking for Old West movie history, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a theme park with lots of opportunities to spend money over and above the admission price, you've come to the right place. Overall, its not worth the price.

Weddings occur often here:-Formerly Australian Pines were the highest level  of this point.  The wind whispered through them on soft days and wailed through in the squalls and hurricanesover the years.  Some pretty spectacular birds hunted and nested among them.If you walked very quietly, you could surprise the sand around the tidal pools into seeming to move, shifting sideways or upwards.  Seemingly a million tiny Fiddler crabs would shift simultaneously in the direction.  Their sand colour Rd bodies are perfectly camouflaged until they move!Those old pines helped to retain the.barrier island that forms Fort Myers Beach with their reverse canopy of roots below the sands.  Sadly, native plants became preferred here too and they too were eradicated, just like the white paper bark eucalyptus that used to grow along the roads of so much of South Florida.Sunsets are de rigueur Here. We walk out to get the full worldwide view reflected in the waters & sinking into Sanibel Island til the light house and the pirate ship lights come on.Sand dollars and sting ray and an occasional starfish can be found on these broad white clean beaches.  They are cleaned every morning.  Sanibel catches most of the shells across the way, before dropping off into a much rougher surf.  Sanibel is not a friendly beach to the handicapped or the unsteady.It angles far too sharply toward the water. It is exceptionally level for everyone!  Fort Myers Beach, however does not require a toll and is far more friendly to.visitors, except in parking. No driving on the beach, Boys chasing seagulls are about as fast as it gets.  This is a family beach.But occasionally, the Pink Shell sets out dining tables with linens, china and silver, perhaps candles, and serves dinner right out on the sand!", "meta": {"review_id": "g34231-d2704557-r513961814", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1670, 1709, "Exclusion"], [1899, 1916, "Exclusion"], [1996, 2019, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 135, "text": "Lower antelope canyon. There are only two tour places that do the lower canyons. I didn't do the upper antelope canyons. I purchased a regular tour ahead with Ken Tours. When you get to their location you go to check in at a line outside the building. Then go inside the building to wait for your time tour to be called. They have a very strict rule of  what you can bring in: no backpacks or purses but then allow camelbaks which are as big or bigger than mini backpacks. You can bring water bottles and a camera but no camera bag . They do allow for fanny packs in case you're from the 1970s and own one still lol.  I had an issue because I have to carry epipens for allergy to fire and carpenter ants so I need them on my body at all times so I brought a mini backpack to keep them enclosed in so they wouldn't fall out. The lady at the entrance line to check in was very rude and told me to put them in my pockets, no backpacks yet I had zero pockets on my body. Then she looks at my husband and said have him put them in his pockets...um..NOPE. Epipens are supposed to be on the body of the person who needs it, no one else. She continued to harass me about my MINI backpack when I got to the check in line and tried to talk to the check in people about the issue of me needing my epipens with me and they said i was fine with my bag since it was the smallest i found and when there that lady grabbed my arm to tell me no backpack again. Maybe the lady didn't understand it's a life or death situation but the upfront desk seemed to understand what that meant and let me go in and they were nice about letting the tour guide entrance know of my situation. So just beware. From kens tours you literally just walk to a trail behind their building and walk over to the entrance of the antelope canyon that's not very long at all. I wouldn't have put sunblock on since it was so short. You have to take stairs down into the canyon and some are pretty steep so I wouldn't say this is a young kid friendly tour just from the nature of it. You climb up and down stairs throughout the entire tour, tiny gaps that fit one person through and loose sand. The canyon was just gorgeous and every view has its own beautiful essence to it. We spent a good hour or so in it. I loved our tour guide Sylvan, he was very informative and showed us beautiful rock formations like the pirate, eagle, and  lady and he also helped with camera settings on dsl or phones etc to get the right lighting. He took a photo of us towards the end that was gorgeous and a keepsake. Overall the tour itself was beautiful and definitely worth the money on a tour. It is very crowded throughout so stay close to your travel buddy and hopefully not claustrophobic. Showed photo of me and tour guide looking at camera so you can see how crowded it is. For those looking at tours, horseshoe bend is a free destination no tour needed. It's about 10 minutes or less from antelope canyon and you just park and go. The hike is a good 20 minutes or so in unshaded area. There are porta potties there at the beginning by parking. I'll include photos of both. Also just a warning on horseshoe bend there is a small part fenced off but very open and not grated so a tiny child could easily climb through and fall off the cliff I personally would not bring any littles who don't listen unless strapped in a baby carrier.

{"id": 139, "text": "My husband and I went to Maui for one week. During our preparation we found Lahaina old lu'au online and booked it a few weeks in advance. And we weren't disappointed at all. First of all, we were welcomed with flower necklaces and cocktails. We entered a wonderful area right at the shore with many beautiful flowers, decorations and views that made us feel very much like being on Hawaii and inspired wonderful pictures, that you could take yourself or get it taken.With our reservation everything went smooth and friendy. After the warm welcome we were assisted to our perfect places in the front directly to the round stage. Every table had place for 8 people and the place was comfortable instead of stuffed and crowded. You were able to choose in advance, if you preferred chairs or cushions on the floor. We chose last and enjoyed it to be so close to the stage. But before the lu'au started you could wander around the area where artists showed the old hawaiian ways of craft and sports. It was an open bar all night with delicious drinks that would also be served once we were sitting. But at the beginning we enjoyed the time strolling around the beautiful area. The first highlight was getting the pig out of the natural sand floor oven. It was quite a show and they took their time to communicate with the guests and especially the kids for having a fantastic start in the evening. They explained how it was prepared and taught some Hawaiian vocabulary and culture. When the buffet started it was perfectly organized, so that no one had to wait. And all the time a hawaiian band was playing live. The food was delicious and we tried everything while our waitress didn't let us go thirsty.As soon as everybody sat with a full plate, Dancers and singers entertained us on stage. But it wasn't until desert, which was brought to the tables, that the real show started, how I would call it. That is becauae it was not only some dancing, it was a full ride through hawaiian history and the art of the hula dance and the story of their Gods. They also showed how the the Western/ Christs arrived on the island and how this changed their way of the dance, clothing and - in my opinion - their way of live under the oppression. But they did not point a finger it is just my interpretation that a culture like this lost so much more than they won after being", "meta": {"review_id": "g60634-d104288-r502337696", "category": "family"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 17, "Inclusion"], [635, 663, "Inclusion"], [694, 724, "Inclusion"], [1030, 1046, "Inclusion"], [1329, 1393, "Inclusion"], [1609, 1631, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 151, "text": "If you're a fan of Cirque du Soleil, you'll definitely like this. If you've never seen one of their shows, you'll like it even more. In terms of the acts and stunts, they're not that different from the usual stuff except for one little detail that sometimes makes a big difference: water. In fact, all of the 150 technicians and 85 cast members have a scuba certification. It's a really fascinating experience because you kind of get a two-for-one in that sense. There is so much going on onstage that you never really know where to look. It's bursting with creativity.If you're wondering about seats, I feel your pain. I thought long and hard before finally getting tickets in the third row of section 303, right in the center. If you're on a tight budget but you really want to go, I would say these work just fine. I did not want to risk limited view because I figured it would bug me the entire time. Section 303 is high up and feels a tad far sometimes, but it's not a bad thing because the stage goes pretty far back once the curtain opens, so at least you get a nice holistic view. The only two downsides were the fact that you couldn't see the clowns going through the audience at the beginning because they're under you, and the fact that during some parts of the show there's a light coming from the stage that shines right in your eyes.You are not allowed to take pictures during the show, but feel free to do so before and after. I took a picture of the view from my seat to give you guys an idea of what it's like to sit in section 303. They don't usually have discount tickets for this show, so it's ok to just go talk to someone at the official ticket office at the Bellagio and they'll give you more seat info.

Our hotel is in Kuta, which was about 1,5 hours driving from our hotel. This was quite long, but at the end it was worth it.The entrance not really expensive. When entering the park you are shown the rules. Do not feed the monkeys, do not touch them and do not smile at them  they see that as an act of agression Also you need to make sure you do not have loose items on you, such as sunglasses, hats etc. Just ot be sure. The monkeys are not agressive at all, but also not scared of people. You can approach them really closely. There are a few feeding stations where the monkeys are gathering if they are hungry. You can see them eating corn and sweet potatoes. Plenty of staff was around to keep an eye out for the safety of the monkeys and the visitors. Also i was able to get some corn from a staffmember to feed a monkey sitting on my shoulder. It costed me 20.000 Rupia which is a little over 1 Euro. This gave me a great oppertunity to get even closer to the monkeys for a nice photo. The monkeys can move around freely and do whatever they want. If they wish to stay away from the people, they have all possibilities to do so. If they would like to be close to people, they also can. We spend about 1,5 hours in the park. Having a nice relaxing walk and look at all the funny monkeys doing their monkeybusiness.

The dolphin show is very good , bit Eurovision in places in terms of the music , but this adds to the fun ! A lovely little park, however the code of conduct and behaviour of some of the parks guests needs serious review. During my visit to one particular part of the park a young children's splash zone , which had literally just opened, I noticed two older men appeared minus children , and started frolicking in the splash zone , and looking around, and put it like this they weren't eyeing up the dads !  and definitely not the mothers!  This was clearly a children's play area and I was not at all comfortable with this , I complained to the lifeguard, explaining that I found the two gentlemens behaviour inappropriate and why would two grown men have an interest in going into a young children's splash zone?  Unless they were of course specialist  paediatric consultants researching child behaviour supervised by a team and a crew , which indeed and of course they were not  . Unfortunately I don't think the guard had a clue what I was talking about as the response I received was a shrug of the shoulders? I'm not sure what kind of a response that is but quite frankly it doesn't take a lot of working out no matter what language barriers may be there to suss out A/ when a women is not happy and B/ when she is pointing at young children, old men saying no, no, no !! With that I did what any concerned parent would do removed my child and moved on. My husband also wasn't prepapared for a rather large butt naked rear end appearing in his face as he was riding with our child on the carousel ride , poor guy didn't know where to look! now I don't know if you have ever seen people riding on a roundabout in public In a tshirt and thongs, this my friend is entertainment in itself , hilarious! Hope the seats get a good wash ! Very brits abroad , nice white beer gut all out , carrying pints, fag in gob ! LOVELY isn't it , because of course that's exactly what everybody wants to see when they go on a day out ! Come on people, sharpen up ! Great park, shame about the guests lacking basic social standard, should be no smoking , and cover up in food areas / restaurants at least . Just standard conduct and etiquette really. But the park should have improved codes of conduct. This would not be allowed in places such as seaworld. Food and pricing exactly what you would expect from any theme park.

{"id": 164, "text": "Even though I normally abhor guided tours, in this case I booked one and found it very helpful for a few reasons. First, the pyramid entrances aren't accessible by public transit so you'll need to get a taxi or driver regardless, so a tour that includes a ride from your hotel is something that everyone will need. Second, having a guide with you is a built-in photo-taker, which is of course helpful but especially so here, where everyone is looking to make a few bucks by 'doing you a favor'. Third, a driver working with your guide can give you rides in between the disparate sites, even within the gates of the complex--which saves a bunch of time that you would spend walking or getting gouged by drivers of horse-drawn carriages. Fourth, and perhaps most importantly, having a guide with you somehow keeps the hordes of local touts from harassing you. Everyone online complains about how often and persistent the harassment by touts is inside the gates of the attraction. We arranged the tour through our hotel the day before taking it, which made it convenient to just charge it to the room and limit the amount of cash we needed to expend. I can't speak to the value of hiring a guide you find at the entrance.We had read online about poor treatment of horses and camels by the local touts. However, our guide claimed that a small number of camel handlers were government-licensed. We hired a ride from them and rode out across the sand to a place where you could get great photos and views of all 6 pyramids. That little ride cost us $30 for two people and there was no fighting with the camel handler afterwards about the price. Overall the pictures of that mini-excursion were worth it.The solar boat museum was interesting as well but requires an extra ticket be bought at that entrance; it can't be bought with your main entrance ticket. It was amazing how large a boat was made just to be buried with a king.In all, of course, everyone needs to see the pyramids if you come to Cairo. We bought the ticket which did not include going inside the great pyramid. That significantly increases the price of your ticket and I am told there is nothing to see in there except empty stone rooms in the darkness. You can go inside other smaller pyramids or crypts for no extra cost.

If there was one low point in the entire trip, it was during the row-boat ride up a narrow channel of water festooned with water lilies, and serenaded by the chirping bird life in the trees only to spot a Vodaphone advertising banner stuck precariously in to the side of the bank.", "meta": {"review_id": "g297631-d940955-r263297545", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[626, 658, "Exclusion"], [748, 771, "Inclusion"], [820, 857, "Inclusion"]]}

We visited the British Music Experience only a few months ago - for a more modest- and were hugely impressed with what it had to offer. I couldn't help but compare the two in this case: here there are hardly any original artefacts at all - just replicas and recreations. Maybe only John Lennon's glasses and his old guitar were actually confirmed as the real deal.Granted, the Cavern recreation is extremely clever and lifelike and very close to the original venue on Mathew Street, but having live bands playing the stage - or even a British Music Experience-like video or even 'hologram' of the Beatles on it - wouldn't go amiss. Instead we have audio commentary from speakers above and Twist And Shout blaring out at full volume!. The place is obviously a tourist trap as it was very busy when we visited in early September, but the quality of the exhibits - plus some truly cringeworthy typos and mistakes in the text what is that all about? - leave a bit to be desired. It's all very nicely laid out amidst the subterranean catacombs which twist and turn in every direction, but once you get to the White Room with the fake piano, and checked out the special exhibition on the Beatles In India okay, and the Strawberry Fields gates a selfie favourite you're left with a feeling of 'is that it?'.

Or go into a reptile pavilion and most of the reptiles are hidden under rocks or foilage? Pass by an exhibit only to see signs saying it is temporary closed?I fully expected this when we visited the Saint Louis Zoo. I was very happy to see almost all of the animals, yes, even those that were sleeping and resting, very easily. There were a few exhibits closed for cleaning but very few. I appreciate the zoo for minimizing the number of exhibits closed during visitation hours.We went on a very hot day. The temperatures were in the nineties. The walkways throughout the zoo have lots of tall trees and therefore full leafy canopies for shade. Benches were positioned in these shady areas...and there were many benches! The zoo is landscaped in a way that a breeze flows through, nice! Both keep it's visitors cool even during that hottest day of 2018. The zoo is filled to the brim with multitudes of flowers and well kept foilage. I felt as though I was walking through a huge garden as well as a zoo. I visited this zoo many many years ago and remember it's one-of-a-kind stone carved columns and more both outside and inside the animal pavilions. Back then, inside most pavilions were lush garden courtyards with more columns around them. The zoo kept these architectural features and the central indoor gardens! Needing to expand pavilions to create roomy animal enclosures, they built their new large animal exhibits and fitted the architecture from the original zoo into the new buildings, seamlessly! I had to point out the old stonework carvings and columns to friends there on their 1st visit. The original enclosed and sunroof domed garden areas are also still there in the restructured buildings. So the old zoo easily blends into the new and expanded buildings.Tips:I highly recommend giving yourself 3 hours or more to visit. There are just so many wonderful animals to see. All walkways were easily accessible for people needing wheelchairs and other such devices to visit the zoo. The restroom facilities were clean and well-stocked. Employees continually were checking their condition. The Lakeside Restaurant, centrally located, was our fav' place to stop and eat. And remember, while the zoo itself is free? You will be charged a parking fee. We went on a very busy day and were able to park close to an entrance. There are several entrances...so bring that phone in case you are meeting someone else and you happen to park in different areas. Bring a rechargeable phone battery as well. DEFINITELY.

Tempted to do the guided 1hr tour $10 extra, but after looking at the floor plan of the place decided against it. Everything is very easy to find if you have a map. This allows you to spend time on the things that interest you, speed through the things perhaps you find less interesting. We started the touring at 1:30PM and stayed until 5PM!! We started out by watching the orientation video 5min on the same level as the cafe...then went in the following order:- Berlin Wall exhibit concourse- took our time through levels 6, 5, 4 you start at the top and work your way down- had to do a faster pace on levels 3, 2, 1- made it to the last viewing of their 4D movie at 4:30pm video was average, informative but I feel more entertaining for youth- took the stairs back down to the concourse for the FBI exhibit By that time it was 5PM in an eye blink!

We didn't eat at any of the numerous restaurants around the O2 as they looked quite busy but there's every type of food you could ask for available. There's a handy newsagent-type shop to get drinks and snacks. Other attractions here are a Nissan car interactive experience, Star Wars exhibition and a cinema.The concert itself was amazing but we had a few issues with the organisation:1 Why do they have to charge so much for drinks and then take the tops off water bottles so that you can't carry more than one without spilling it? There were no drinks holders in our seats block A2 Row D so we had it constantly on our lap and overtime we had to get up to let someone past frequently it would spill. Also, as there was no interval in the show, we had to make one bottle of water last all night as we couldn't carry anymore than this when we bought them as we also had 2 VIP merchandise bags plus our own bags to carry. On the hottest night of the year this was not fun.2 Security was quite lax considering recent events. My bag was not fully checked and I could have taken forbidden items in and I doubt they would have seen them.3 Beware if you have merchandise to collect. We thought we would go in at 18:00 when the doors opened, collect our VIP merchandise bags, take them back to the hotel and then go back to the concert at 20:00. But no. I had just got through security and was about to have my ticket scanned thank goodness I didn't! when I heard an announcement that tickets only permit entry once - there is no exit and re-entry allowed! My husband was outside as he didn't want to come in just to get the merchandise so I had to practically beg to be escorted back out as I hadn't realised that you couldn't go in and out on the ticket!! This should be made more clear as if I hadn't heard the announcement at that particular moment I would have been through into the venue and my husband would have been outside without a ticket or any way of finding out what was going on!The seating itself is crowded on the lower levels with not much leg room, especially when people want to get in and out during the performance. Exits could be made clearer and drinks holders on the seats would be a good idea. The front row seats were shocking when we left with water and drinks spilled all over the floor.

Review of AttractionsShould You Take Your Kids To The Biltmore Estate?When traveling to Asheville, North Carolina one of the first attractions that comes to my mind is the Biltmore Estate. Visiting the Biltmore has been on my bucket list for many years, but is touring a mansion dating back to the 1800's something my son would enjoy? I must admit I had my reservations about taking my kid to the Biltmore. Would he find it enjoyable? Would my tour of the estate be ruined with whining from boredom?Should you take your kids to the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina? Here is my experience and recommendations:What is the Biltmore Estate?Standing in front of the Biltmore EstateWhat is the Biltmore Estate?The Biltmore Estate was built by George W. Vanderbilt in 1895 on over 8,000 acres. The mansion was opened on Christmas Eve after six years of construction. It was the family home to George, his wife Edith, their daughter Cornelia and their beloved family Saint Bernard, Cedric. Cornelia married in 1924 and the couple then opened the home to the public in 1930.The cost to visit can range from $50-$80 per person depending on the time of year to visit, day you visit, and the type of ticket you purchase. There are several additional things you can add on to your ticket price such as a self-guided audio tour, lunch buffet, special events, etc.You can tour the mansion, gardens, Conservatory, barn, farm, as well as Antler Village. Your ticket also includes a complimentary wine tasting.Should you take kids to the Biltmore?Should you take your kids to the Biltmore?The short answer is yes! I would recommend taking your children on the tour of the Biltmore Estate and surrounding gardens, Conservatory, Farm, and Village, however wait until your child is a bit older. It is my opinion a child eight and older would enjoy the tour. Though there is a trolley that takes you around the property, there is still quite a bit of walking involved. In just touring the home, you will be going up and down many flights of stairs. Having a child who has more stamina, does not need a stroller, and who is capable of spending an entire day with stimulation and not needing a nap would be beneficial.What is there to do with kids at the Biltmore?Surprisingly, there is an abundance of child friendly activities and sights when visiting the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. Here are my recommendations on things you must do:Purchase the child audio tourBrady listening to the audio tour while visiting the Biltmore EstateBrady loved the kid-friendly audio tourTo have access to the Biltmore mansion and surrounding estate is one ticket price prices vary on day of the week and time of the year you plan to go. The self-guided audio tour is an additional cost. Is it worth it? Yes, yes, and yes! I highly recommend purchasing the audio tour for an additional $11.21 each person.There is an adult version of the audio tour, but there is also a kid version of the same tour. The kid-friendly version of the tour is narrated by the Vanderbuilt's family Saint Bernard, Cedric. My son absolutely loved it. As you move through the home, there are numbers you enter into your audio tour. The tour explains what you are seeing. I can attest I was worried my son would be bored, but boredom was not an issue. In fact, he would get angry if my husband and I would move from a room if his audio was not done playing. Brady wanted to hear it all!The Barn, Farmyard, and PlaygroundMy son visited the Barn at the Biltmore EstateYou can view exhibtis from blacksmiths, woodworkers, and interpreters when visiting the Barn Located near the Antler Village is the Biltmore Estate Barn, Farmyard, and Playground. Here you can pet and see farm animals to include horses, goats, and chickens. There is a playground for children to play on. In addition, you can view exhibits by blacksmiths, woodworkers, and knowledgeable interpreters.Read my personal blog for a full review.

{"id": 234, "text": "We took our daughter to Schlitterbahn this past weekend for her birthday. I have quite a bit to say about it, but overall it was very fun. It is a little dated looking- especially the lodging. It looks a little like stepping back in time to old motels. We stayed at the Waserhaus so that we got free admission. We got there Saturday midday because we had several hours to drive. We went right to the place to check in and waited about 10 minutes. There was no one in line ahead of us, it just takes a while to check people in. When you check in you get two bands- one showing that you are a guest staying on property that you don't cut off until you leave the park for good and one that is your ticket for the day. We were able to go to our room because it was ready early. We drove over, unloaded quickly and walked across the street to the entrance that is by the season pass ticket office. It is probably a 7 minute walk from the Waserhaus to the entrance because you have to follow the sidewalk down away from the park and then once inside you can walk over to the park entrance. There is someone there to check your bags and ice chests. There were several tables in the shade open right there, so we took one of those. I went to the area where the lockers are to get our Blast Passes. It took probably 10 minutes to get them. Totally worth it! My husband watched our teen and preteen play on the kid's area there because there are several fun slides that hardly have any line. We set our blast pass up for the Master Blaster which was a 45min wait at the time and then we hit the Falls first. To get to The Falls, you walk out the way you came back in and kind of head down hill. You'll cross a bridge and then see a little beach area where you grab a tube and then circle around, head up the conveyer belt, and then ride in the big loop that is the Falls. It's really fun- little areas of rapids. let me say after reading other's reviews I felt like I somehow needed to take their advice on the order of rides, etc. But you don't! It's small enough you can figure it out when you get there! After the falls it was about time for the master blaster. We walked right up the stairs and got scanned in once our watches said ride time and rode it. I was really scared once we were up there- I didn't need to be! It is so much fun! You do need to kind of lift your bottom up so it doesn't try to pull of your bottoms of your swim suit. When it first takes off there is a fun drop and then it goes through a small tunnel and then it is the scariest part of the ride- a really fun drop. It isn't scary just fun. Then you are good. The closed in part toward the end of the ride made me nervous because I get claustrophobic really easily. But it has little places where the paint is scratched and light comes through so it isn't scary- just fun. We rode it one more time on Sat and then twice on Sunday! Totally worth the wait. And honestly the only ride I'd wait for. Our daughters did the Black Knight and didn't like it. It's totally dark and SO extremely hot inside. Then we used our blast passes for the Wolfpack. It was fairly fun. But I would not wait in line for it. Use your blast pass or don't go. If you are going to wait in line I feel like the only one worth waiting for is the Master Blaster. Then we did the wave pool lazy river thing that is right below the Master Blaster and other big rides. It is so fun. But be warned- they stop the big waves about 20 minutes before closing. It is such a disappointment and not advertised. They just suddenly stop. We walked down to Surfenberg. We rode Dragon's Revenge and we didn't like it, but it is our friend's favorite. If you are limited on time, just stay around Blastenhoff unless you have younger kids- then it would be worth the walk over. I kind of felt like we wasted time walking over to Surfenberg. The second day we chose not to come in the park an hour early because our daughters were so tired. We had to walk to the season pass office because it was the closest ticket office to us and get our tickets for the day. It was quick for us, but my husband waited 15 minutes before finally asking if he could just get his ticket. The lady in front of him was getting season passes. So ask as soon as you get there! We parked our car in that lot and were allowed to leave it there because we had been hotel guests. We started on the newer side for the girls to play in the wave pool/ lazy river thing that is below the master blaster. We then walked out and took all of our stuff with us to grab the shuttle to ride to the other side. This is a bit of walk- not huge, but not just right out the front gate. When you get off at the other side and walk in- you go in through the gift shop and then come out and they will recheck your bags. If you aren't sure where to go, go to the left and walk through the restaurant and onto their deck. You are up high and it wasn't crowded when we were there. They have picnic tables on the deck. And there is a bathroom right inside so it's perfect. You just head downstairs and to the right once you are at the bottom of the stairs to get to the Hillside Tube Chute and the Raging River Tube Chute. We didn't get blast passes for Sunday because they weren't offering them. We stood in line for the Hillside Tube Chute. It was probably at least 30 minutes and totally NOT WORTH IT!! The Falls on the other side are so much better. And the water is freezing. Raging River is better then Hillside and takes you to the other side. Once you get there you can ride the Congo Ride and it has a really fun slide at the end of it- I think they call it a waterfall. Not scary, just fun. It was great. The pools over there by it are nice and not busy.After the west side we rode back over and stayed until exactly 6pm when we had to leave. The lines were short at the Master Blaster so we rode it again, did the wave pool, and The Falls. Those were our favorites for sure. It was really fun because it wasn't too busy that day. On busy days I wouldn't go without a blast pass unless you have little kids because you'd waste your whole day standing in line.

{"id": 242, "text": "Let me start this off by saying: this place is almost always packed to the brim on weekends - especially Saturdays. With that said, I would recommend only going to this park on a weekday, particularly Mondays, Tuesdays, or Thursdays. On to the main review then. This is definitely an excellent park with world class coasters. In fact, I would say the coasters alone can almost make it worth the price. The newest addition, the Iron Rattler, is almost always one of the busier rides. Even so, the staff on -that- ride do an excellent job of efficiently loading/unloading the trains to get the line moving fairly quickly. Some of the other big names, such as poltergeist, and superman, can't boast as much on loading times. They also fairly frequently don't have enough trains on the track to handle the amount of guests in any given line. Poltergeist can do two, superman three. Those two usually have one and two trains on the track, respectively.The other three coasters won't usually have any kind of ridiculous wait on them, unless it's the weekend. And they're definitely worth checking out in their own right.Another selling point of the park, is their -free with admission of course water park. I can't say too much on this, since if I go to the water park..It's usually just for the lazy river and wave pool. On those two, they're both frequently crowded. Not like they aren't fun or anything, but if you're claustrophobic, they might not be very awesome to you. The rides, unfortunately suffer the same fate as the dry rides, of very long lines. Only in the water park, they're bound to be long regardless of what day of week it is. And I have also noticed that they tend to have a lack of tubes/mats/other riding things. To the point that you'll be waiting in line.. to get a tube.. just to get in another line. Another big complaint I have of the water park, is the whole place is concrete sidewalks, or otherwise a -very- uncomfortable hard plastic mat that they sometimes out on the stairs. This makes walking without shoes a nightmare. That sidewalk is scorching hot.Yet another selling point of the park, are their shows. This is one aspect that they do most excellently in. The Rockville High show is very..quirky, and quite hilarious at the same time. The Roadhouse Country show is very well played. Excellent voices and lots of skill with the instruments. And although I haven't seen Ovation this year personally, the performance last year was beyond spectacular. To be fair though, I am a fan of musicals. The food is really nothing special here. It's standard theme park food made and served in a fashion similar to fast food, though unfortunately much slower. The employees do one order at a time, and very rarely, if ever, hold any orders. Also, be prepared to spend a small fortune if you have any kind of group with you. It can cost between 8 and 12 dollars per person -- without drinks. Drinks are another 4.50. I can however, recommend Primo's Pizzeria. Their pizza isn't half bad, though again, very expensive.Overall then, I would wholeheartedly recommend this park. Just be prepared for the amount of money it will cost you, or otherwise bring food with you not into the park. And definitely don't visit on the weekend if you can help it.", "meta": {"review_id": "g60956-d105060-r228148514", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[47, 79, "Exclusion"], [94, 114, "Exclusion"], [140, 186, "Inclusion"], [385, 400, "Inclusion"], [1342, 1361, "Exclusion"], [1405, 1460, "Exclusion"], [1534, 1552, "Exclusion"], [2528, 2563, "Exclusion"], [3021, 3035, "Exclusion"], [3094, 3151, "Exclusion"]]}

{"id": 245, "text": "Visited 28th August 2018.I visited yesterday with my 5 year old daughter. We had a fantastic day. I chose to pay extra for an early play session with Peppa and George she is 6 in September so suspect next year she would be too old for this. As a one off treat is expensive I think this was worth it. She had a lovely time meeting Peppa and George and loved the play area in Peppa Pig World, especially George's Spaceship play zone to the point I was worried she might want to spend all day on the slides instead of the rides!. The real bonus of this u201Ctreatu201D was the ability to get on some rides early. We went straight onto Peppa's Air Balloon ride, Miss Rabbit's Helicopter and then Grampy Rabbit's Sailing club. We were planning on going on the Queen's castle but as we exited the boat ride the queue's descended. This is the point where I suspect having a 5 year old over 1m tall was an advantage. If she had been younger still Peppa Pig obsessed and shorter we may have needed to stay in Peppa Pig World and I suspect this would have made it a very different day battling long queues and crowds etc.As it was we said hello to the penguins then goodbye to Peppa Pig World and headed out to the rest of the park. It was brilliant. The park is so clean and the planting is beautiful. Next time we will definitely consider a 2 day package because we didn't have time to visit the gardens and animals too. I have one very happy little girl who went on big ride after big ride Flight of the Pterasaur, Velociraptor and River Ride repeatedly and she rode Dino Chase without me see sad mummy face as she takes another growing up step. We never queued for more than 20 minutes but I recognise queues were much much longer in Peppa Pig World as I could see the times on the app.   The staff were all very friendly and helpful, special mention to a young man who was litter picking in the car park when we arrived and directed me to staff parking 3 times without exasperation because I really couldn't believe we were allowed to park there, but apparnatly for early play tickets you can and do, how he didn't show any frustration I will never know, suspect he is used to it.   In terms of food, I have to be honest, my daughter has a rare neurometabolic condition and has to eat a medically prescribed Ketogenic diet. I am therefore very used to packing all her food for the day and stopping for regular snacks. I also know from experience that food provided in these special venues is often over priced so I am an expert at the day long picnic rucksack on my back. I did have a hot dog and my daughter had a hot dog sausage without the bun no discount, but I didn't ask and in all honesty nowhere, that I have bought food for her fast food, pubs or restaurants and asked for things to be left out no buns, no sauces, no sides etc has ever reduced the price so I am used to that expectation, the surprise will be when a venue offers a reduction. Anyway back to the review the hot dogs were hotdogs, tasted fine but at u00A33.50 each I would always suggest to families to pack picnics and snacks though remember no eating or drinking in the queues and perhaps just use food kiosks for a special treat rather than relying on them for your meals.

Our guide was very disengaged almost the entire time we were in Beijing.  When we first arrived to our hotel at night, she asked if we needed her to help us check in.  We felt badly for her since it was so late so we said we could do it ourselves.  BIG MISTAKE.  It turned out they had no reservations for us and with our minimal Mandarin skills, it was a complete mess.  An hour later, our guide came back seemingly annoyed and had to pay out of pocket for our rooms and get reimbursed by China Highlights later.  It was so late that we skipped dinner out and had to order room service and our young kids were so exhausted and irritable.  On another day, our guide got us back to our hotel around 2pm.  It was then that we realized that so long as the guide covers all the places on the itinerary for the day, he or she is free for the rest of the day.  Therefore, there is an incentive for the guides to hurry through their itinerararies.  Fortunately, it was only with the Beijing guide that we observed such self interested behavior.  Also, we got no narration during our van rides which was so disappointing.  Our guides in the other cities all pointed out places as we drove by them, etc.  There was also an upsetting experience with the great wall but i'm just going to spare you the details.  Just make sure that if your itinerary tells you that you will cover a certain part of the great wall, make sure your guide does it.  Again, we enjoyed most of the china highlights guides we had during our visit through china.

{"id": 289, "text": "We loaded the Disney World app on our phone beforehand and arrived at Hollywood Studios about 6:30 am on a weekday in the second week of January 2020.  Having tested the app we knew we had to be inside HS for it to prompt us to seek a boarding group to ride Rise of the Resistance. We parked in the HS lot at about 6:25am and knew HS was scheduled to open at 7am. People were entering at 6:30am when we walked up to the entrance.  We had no bags, so passed through security without a pause, then waited maybe 4 minutes to press our Magic Bands to the sensor and finger to the reader and enter HS. The crowd was already spread out toward Tower of Terror, where it was stopped about halfway, and toward the Toy Story area, where it was held up by barriers just beyond Grumman's Chinese Theater.  Nor was anyone allowed to proceed into the Echo Lake area in front of the Prime Time Diner.  We estimated the crowd to total about 3000 I'd be really interested in Disney's actual number, which hummed with anticipation.  As the clock neared 7am every cellphone in every hand was up and ready to join the lottery.  At the stroke of the hour, a few whoops and hollers announced the first, successful lottery winners and Rise of the Resistance boarding groups began to be assigned.  We caught a boarding group in the high 70's, and from following the action remotely in the days leading up to our visit, estimated our actual time to enter the attraction to be around noon.  In the meantime, all the lines for the other popular HS rides had filled as the crowds flowed into Tower of Terror, Millenium Falcon, Toy Story Mania, to name a few of the most popular.  These all had 30 minute or more wait times by 7:15 am.  Meanwhile, the lottery for Resistance was completed by 7:10am, and it flipped over to the contingent/stand by mode, i.e., no guarantees of entering the attraction. On many days previously we had seen the boarding groups reach into the 120's, or more, so were prepared to accept a much higher number than we actually received.With long lines everywhere and not yet having had breakfast, we left HS and hopped on to the slick new sky tram and traveled over to the nearby Pop Century resort for a food court meal.  It was full daylight by now and we enjoyed walking around a resort we had not previously visited.  Back on the tram, we rode over to Epcot to where the tram dropped us at the International gate, just for the fun of the experience.  Sure enough, we received a message advising of the availability of boarding for the Resistance and made our way back to HS and to the ride entrance.  The system was ready for us and we smoothly passed through the checking point.  Inside is a rather long, for Disney, interior path to the final boarding platform.  With about 15 people ahead of us, the boarding process was halted, and we waited for over 60 MINUTES.  A cast member passed out bottles of water and Chewbacca came through for photo opportunities.  BUT 60 MINUTES is a long wait!  Fortunately, we were behind a chatty family from outside the U.S. and the time finally passed.Not knowing what to expect next is tedious and frustrating, and the occasional announcements did little to inform us.  Thank goodness we weren't trapped further back in the narrow passageway where even the mildly claustrophobic would be challenged to remain calm.  The balance of the ride was a whirlwind of lights, action, and live and animated characters with whom we interacted, observed, and tried to sort out the narrative we supposed to be engaging.  Star Wars fans will find the trip fulfilling and fun, those with a passing interest or knowledge will be baffled.

{"id": 333, "text": "This was our second visit to Chessington we had visited a couple of years ago and the fact that very little seemed to have changed in that time kind of sums up my review.While our kids aged 3.5 and 5 enjoyed their visit and that's probably what really counts here, the overall experience is still one of being underwhelmed. There are perhaps a couple of 'big' rides the Vampire ride and the Dragon's Fury, the rest of the park is really nothing spectacular. The whole place feels claustrophobic and a bit chaotic really.Now, we've been to a few theme parks and this one falls behind most in terms of it's quality quality of rides, staff, attractions etc but also in terms of the overall state of the place. While there are plenty of bins around the park, the amount of litter flying around is shocking admittedly that's largely down to lazy people not bothering to dispose of their litter responsibly but they need to either make the bins more visible or have people keeping on top of the situation.Also, the general upkeep is poor, with a good repaint job required all over the place as it's all looking very 'distressed' in places.The queues at the rides are quite poorly managed too - for a few of the rides where the queues were lengthy 45-70 mins, the staff at the point where you get on the ride itself didn't seem to have any idea about balancing out the number of people on the ride - with some spaces/seats going empty where 2,3 or 4 more people could have got on. Add that all up as it's being done on multiple occasions throughout the day and that's a lot more people who could've got on the ride and spent less time queuing.Two of the rides broke down while we were in the queues Vampire and Dragon's Fury and we had to wait even longer while they sorted out what the issue was and then sent empty cars around the rides to test them a step I completely understand, so no gripes there, just with the fact that they broke down in the first place.The icing on the cake was the farcical situation we were faced with on leaving - complete gridlock in the car parks glorified fields with strips of hardened mud - they must be fun when it's raining!. Considering the number of cars they cater for in the 3 or 4 large car parks, the route out is just not built to handle that volume of cars. It's basically 2 lanes of traffic at a virtual standstill while some poor staff member stands at the two barriers helping people scan their car park payment tickets to enable them to leave yes, you have to pay for parking - it's not included in the price of your admission ticket!!. Factoring in parking or perhaps not charging? into the admission prices would surely mean people could just drive out of the park instead of having to stop to scan their tickets.I admit that, having been to Disneyland in Paris a couple of times, my standards have been set very high and it would be unfair to judge Chessington by those standards. But there is definitely the feeling that this is a park that needs someone to  give it an overhaul and address the issues it has the car park and traffic management being just two and perhaps expanding the site to give it more of a spacious feel and maybe getting a couple more 'major' rides.So, overall, it's a park with great potential the zoo section is very good and the kids loved that but you really get the feeling that the place is struggling to keep up with the increasing number of people who are visiting.", "meta": {"review_id": "g580409-d216483-r689808513", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[176, 207, "Inclusion"], [462, 494, "Exclusion"], [1218, 1251, "Exclusion"], [3293, 3312, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 343, "text": "I really wasn't sure what I was getting into from the brief description in the Liberty of Sea Excursion booklet.  Because I'm interested in traditional medicine I decided to check it out and am I ever glad I did.  It's astounding that this group of dedicated workers pulled off such a nurturing and immersive healing  experience in the midst of the craziness of tourists from three cruise boats shopping, drinking and partying.  We had quick but deep view into traditional Mayan and Nuhualt approach to wellness of the spirit and mind through body work.  I say deep because this was no lecture or slideshow, we got to go right into the activities to purify our spirits starting with a copper cleansing like a smudge with the smoke from burning herbs 'bathing' us.  Then we moved to a bath where herb infused warm water was poured on our heads and shoulders.  Then moved to a sauna where more medicinal herbs were burning and we were invited to set our intentions for what we needed to be well in our lives.  The sauna was very, very dark close  to black out and one of our group wanted to leave due to claustrophobia but through the use of a rattle given to her, and drumming and lots of yelling we all did at the top of our lungs she over came her fear and hung in there.  Our guide Geraldo, the Xaman,  was very skilled in managing this.  He did the equivalent of 'talking her down' using his own traditional methods while respecting her right to leave at any moment.  He sang us three beautiful melodic songs in the Nuhualt language. After we'd been in maybe 15 or 20 minutes, and down a lot of screaming,  the Xaman invited us to leave all our fears in the fire of the sauna.  We  hugged each other and  moved on to another circular room where we received clay to make a mask to help liberate ourselves from bad habits, to renew ourselves.  The Xaman  talked to us about love in our hearts, about leading our lives with love for each other, including our enemies. Then he  brought us each water to wash off the clay.  I was is such an altered state by then, in a good way, and so grateful to the Xaman for his skill I thought the experience was as full as it could be and complete.  Our Xaman Geraldo was very gracious, I felt such kindness and caring from him.  Remarkable!  Thank you Geraldo!I completely forgot there was a coconut bath, which included trained, intelligent  neck and scalp massage by Marcos.  Then we were done, I thought, but no.  Then there was the full body massage in the hammock, again very skillfully done with special attention to the feet and hands,  And then we were finally done.  How long did this take?  I don't really know.  We got A LOT 'done' in a short time.Ali, the manager/coordinator oriented us at the start, she showed us our lockers, and our personal beachside cabana that was ours for the day.  She organized us into groups of six, and we went through in the order that we were waiting in at the initial pier meeting place. We were delivered a lovely lunch to our cabana -  sandwiches of fish and shrimp, guacamole, corn chips.  Roberto, our waiter, never let me have an empty glass.  This was all included.  Ali then came around to talk to each of us to get feedback and it was talking to her that I learned the retreat was based on consultations with Mayan and Nahualt people trained in traditional healing.  My hat is off to them for putting together a deep and tourist 'genuine' sampler experience in a short time period in the middle of the crazy hubbub of the port.  Obviously this was a representational experience packaged so we visitors coming off the cruise ship could just walk over to it.  And what an experience.   I felt very lucky to have participated.

This can be skipped as there are a number of kiosks to get setup.  Loved the life-sized plane hanging from the ceiling.  Had to rush over to the Boeing Center because they were closing at 2 PM for a special event.  Found out the submarine show was sold out...which sucked.  Took the stairs to the 2nd floor and the walkways were so cramped with people looking at the planes hanging from the ceiling and displays on the walkway.  They should have made the walkways wider for people to pass by.  We then waited for the elevator on the 2nd floor to go up to the 3rd floor.  You could not take stairs from the 2nd to 3rd floors.  Every time the doors opened, the elevator was full from people on the first floor.  We caught a break as the elevator was going down and some people got off.  A large group of us decided to take the ride down to 1 and then take the ride back up to 3.  Once up on 3rd floor, same issue with no room to walk by as people and displays were blocking the aisles.Once we finished the Boeing Center, we made our way to the Tokyo and Berlin displays.  Some of the signs were in the dark and hard to read.  Loved the video clips and displays.  Wish we had time to enjoy them, but it was so crowded.  Liked the virtual guide aspect, but I think hand sanitizer should be make available at each of the stations.  Hundreds of people touch those hand sets to hear their guide.Ended up leaving right after the Tom Hanks presentation Beyond All Boundaries, which is very cool.

We walked around a bit , the kidsboth 7 and dad swam with the dolphins and loved all the interaction time, kisses and foot push across the water. The staff were friendly and answered any questions.Washrooms,changerooms, showers inside and out were clean. We then went to eat the buffet lunch we got for 20 $ and 7 $ a kid. It was ok nothing special, bbq chicken or burger or hotdog, fries, small corn, rice, beets or few other options, sugary punch or lemonade and apple or orange. No desserts and only one plate per person, so fill up!We headed to Beach area where the kids played on floaties in the water. There were hammocks in the palms to lounge on, lounge chairs, a giant chess game or Jenga to use. Volleyball and music playing. There was a bar for drinks to purchase as well.The only downside of this experience is the last boat back to Nassau was 4 pm sharp and believe me when you swim with dolphins, eat lunch walk a bit and beach for 1 hr it's over!

The film is included in the cost of your tour ticket!The film explains how, at an early age, Hearst's parents instilled in him an appreciation and love of art and antiquities.  It also shows how Architect Julia Morgan was appointed to build and furnish Hearst Castle with a lavish collection of artefacts and antiquities over a period of almost thirty years from 1919 to 1947.We attended the 12:00 noon film showing before taking our online pre-booked 1:20pmRoomsand then our 2:40pmSuites Touru201D.After the film, we had about 25 minutes which was just enough time to eat a slightly rushed snack at the Visitor Centrebefore meeting our first tour at about 1:05pm.The drive from the Visitor Centre to the Castle takes about 10 minutes during which time the driver explains some of the history of the grounds.Between our tours we did not have to return to the Visitor's Centre and stayed at the castle with about 20 minutes to spare before we had to meet our 2:40pm tour at the arrival meeting point.The Guides on both of our tours were very informative, knowledgeable and were able to provide numerous amusing anecdotes that enabled us to imagine what it would have been like to have been a guest, during the heyday of Hollywood, when Hearst's guests included such dignitaries as Charlie Chaplin, Cary Grant, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, James Stewart, Bob Hope, Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill.The Grand Rooms Tour took us on a 60 minute guided tour from the outside of the building through the Assembly Room, the Refectory, the Billiard Room and the Movie Theatre.The Upstairs Tour took us on a 60 minute guided tour through the Doge's Suite, the Library, the Gothic Suite, the Duplex Bedrooms and the Celestial Suite.The structure of the building, the internal decoration, the elaborate furnishing and the artefacts are all extremely impressive.Both tours include the beautiful Gardens, the stunning outdoor Neptune Pool and the impressive indoor Roman Pool all of which you can walk round, at your leisure, and take in the fantastic views from the terraces.There are also Guest Cottages within the castle grounds and aandTour which we could not fit in.

You see their are 13 separate area's. But be WARNED.!!!!!!!!!!Section/Area 13 is commonly used for nude sunbathing. You don't have to but probably 96% that are on that section are nude or partially nude. So if you have a problem see naked folks, DON'T tread their. Stay South of Area 12.My wife and friends love this section of beach. No need for tanning beds. Parking is always at a premium. You may have to go to 12 and walk back down.No lifeguards or flags warning of conditions, so be careful.Also you will see the occasional pervert walking and gawking, but no one's ever been a problem. So if you enjoy nudism, this beach rocks if not you have 11 other separate beachs that rock to choose from.

If you want a specific hour be sure to book your place weeks before. We tried to book a tour at 11am one week before our visit, and the only booking available was at 4:45pm.The inside tour takes approx 30 min and you are not allowed to take photos within the rooms. You can then take photos in a terrace overlooking Marienbru00FCcke. We were staying in Munich and to visit the castle we caught a train fromHauptbahnhof to Fussen. There are direct trains to Fussen and others that have one train change. The change is easy enough as train stations were very small unlike the one at Munich. Recommend going on a Saturday or Sunday if you are a group of 2 or more as there is an offer for train ticket prices that allow you to payfor the first person and justeuros for every additional person upto 5 persons.Once at Fussen there is a bus that takes you up to Hohenschwangau village. Ticket for this bus is included in the offer outlined above. From here you need to walk up the road to the ticket office to get your tickets, including any prebooked tickets. Further up are the buses that take you up to the Castle. We found a long queue there. Tourists are packed tightly in these buses especially if there are long queues!  For this bus you pay the driver directly. If you are not paying to visit Hohenschwangau castle still allow some time to visit the grounds and outside grounds that are free of charge, as there are beautiful views of the lake from there. To get to this castle just climb the stairs once you are past the ticket office. Since our tour started late in the afternoon, we also managed to fit in a visit to Fussen which is a very picturesque village and also a visit to their castle - Hohes Schloss.

There is a lots of restoration and re-building going on, but much has already been restored and it would be nice to see what it looks like a few years from now. I spotted a colonial building being developed into an hotel with a view across the water to the new district which would make a lovely base!  There are lots ofand bars, a few shops and an open air market area if you walk around the old walls. I just don't understand some of the negative reviews - yes, it is a bit rough around the edges, and you need to keep your wits about you at the edges of the tourist area. I even saw one review where the reviewer complained about feeling claustrophobic in the fairly narrow streets!  God help them in small English villages but I guess they can cope with that as it is 'nice' and sanitised. The narrow streets are part of Casco Viejo's charm - and a great deal more attractive than some north American cities with wide freeways dedicated to drivers where no-one walks. We knew instinctively when we had reached the boundary of the slum area but even then no-one bothered us and we headed back towards the more visited areas.

We travelled Friday to Monday check the schedule, they don't leave every week. It was a great experience - a 3 day trip on the inside passage.We arrived in Bellingham Ferry Terminal early on Friday by Greyhound from Seattle.  The ferry terminal has lockers so we could leave our stuff there while we walked to Bellingham for a nice lunch.  Back at the terminal, we stood in line 2 hours before boarding and were first up on deck - so we chose to sleep on a deck chair in the Solarium, protected from winds and under a heat lamp. We became friends with our little 'neighborhood' of travelers and enjoyed swapping stories and trip tips.We were fortunate to enjoy beautiful weather - amazing sunsets, whales, dolphins, eagles. A crew member would offer information on history and geography of the area. There is just enough time to get off the ferry at the short stops on the way; at Ketchikan first stop there is enough time to sightsee and shop we stocked up on groceriesThere are about 30 deck chairs and room for about 20 tents on the upper deck - more room for tents on a lower deck, others slept inside on benches or on recliners in the movie theatre. There are also a few cabins with bunk beds and private bathrooms. The ferry offers a dining room, a snack bar where you can use the microwave to heat up your own food, a cocktail lounge and a free movie theater showing about 6 movies a day. There are plenty of toilet facilities, showers and even laundry machines. Like a floating youth hostel!! I was impressed with how clean everything was. There is no internet, so it was a true disconnect trip. Very relaxing, great views, an opportunity to meet and interact with great people who are making this trip for different reasons.

If you visit in the summer, be prepared for the weather to get up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit or higher in the middle of the day. The best times to hike are during the early morning or the late afternoon to evening, when the temperature is more moderate. Zion National Park has a shuttle line with several different stops, where you can get on and off to hike the different trails. If you don't want to take the shuttle and drive into the park in your own car instead, there is parking, but make sure to arrive early because the parking lots fill up quickly. However, you'll eventually have to take the shuttle bus to many of the destinations in the park, since people aren't allowed to drive past a certain point. My family and I hiked all the way up to Angels Landing, and though it was closed when we went, we were able to stop at a viewpoint called Scout's Lookout instead of hiking on the steep ridge to the end of the trail. Angels Landing is probably the most challenging hike at the park due to its steepness and the sharp drops along the trail, so take caution when attempting this trek. If you have younger children, avoid the strenuous trails like Angels Landing and try hiking the easier trails such as the Riverside Walk and the Emerald Pools trails instead.

There are blindspots all over the stadium compliments of the vision hiding pillars that are numerous and scattered throughout the seating area, for structural purposes , no doubt. The food vendor facilities are archaic, stairs are dangerous to scale and micro water ponds, to slip and slide, are prevalent after rains. It doesn't matter, games are always sold out.

Sooner or later, though, Fenway will have to replaced with a new Fenway.Of particular interest on the field, aside from the players and the game, are the lawn care people. At every chance, these folks appear from nowhere with their 3' grooming brooms to keep the turf in perfectly manicured state. I am told that if there is a dandelion on the field, one of the groomers gets down on their knees and pulls out a pair of giant facial tweezers and plucks the weed out of the ground, root and all.

Cars stay away from any street in close proximity to Fenway because the crowds of people just take over the streets. A significant mobile mall is built up from food trucks and vendor trucks which surrounds Fenway, like a wagon train.Bostonians love their Soxes and are extremely ardent fans.

Fortunately, we were there on a Monday morning and we were able to book our hour slot at 11.30am. It was a gorgeous sunny day and we arrived at 11.20am at the 'walkie talkie' building on Fenchurch Street  a 5 minute walk from Tower Bridge. We went to the main entrance, scanned our tickets in, then went through security, a little like you would at the airport prior to getting into the lift. Around 20 people get in the lift and you go up 35 floors to the garden only take around 40 seconds but a little claustrophobic . When you get out at the top, you enter into the main room which has chairs, tables, champagne corner and a lovely bar area with drinks, cocktails, tea, coffee, cakes, soup of the day and a small snack menu. We wandered outside to the balcony area and took lots of pictures of Tower Bridge, The Shard, St Pauls, etc, then we wandered up stairs as there is another two levels, all planted with tropical plants, small seating areas, great views from every angle and eventually you reach the top which has another bar area, restaurant and more views of London at the back, such as the Gherkin. We went back down and had two coffees and a large carrot cake which cost u00A38.50 in total. Good service. You are free to wander around and basically stay as long as you want. it's a fantastic space and anybody visiting London should do it.We loved it. Whatever we were expecting, it far exceeded it.

Then no drinks or food could be served as employees could not touch anything since they couldn't wash their hands. We had additional tickets for the Shark tour and some of our team had to miss that portion as they had to go outside the facility to either a port-a -potty or across the shopping area to public bathrooms.  Most frustrating part was no acknowledgement about the issue prior to entry or offer for discount or refund for the missed tours due to the issue at hand.

{"id": 481, "text": "The gardens are stunning and peaceful, with lots to see. You're allowed to bring your own beverages, and if you bring a refillable water bottle there are stations here and there in the park to refill with cool water. There are many benches in shaded, scenic spots throughout the garden if you want to sit and rest or read.The garden also has good disabled accessibility. The paths are wide and very rollable. I brought my own mobility scooter on my most recent visit, a smallish-medium sized one Pride Go Go Sport, and had no trouble getting around the terrain, inside and out. I also saw several people being pushed in wheelchairs, and as there aren't loads of steep inclines, this is also doable. The gardens loan wheelchairs for free and rent scooters for about $40 if I recall. BUT, as in all places that rent or loan scooters, you can't count on one being available and charged up when you arrive. The first time I went to this garden a few years back, the only scooter available was one that had only been returned and charging for 10 minutes. No way did I want to get out in the middle of the gardens and have it die! My husband ended up pushing me in a borrowed chair, and it was a hot day, making it a sweaty job for him before it was over. If you're planning a visit that would be ruined if they don't have a working scooter available, my advice is to show up as near to opening time as possible. You'll have a better chance that no one else has taken the few scooters on hand, and hopefully the staff will have remembered to plug them in the night before, so they should be fresh from a full night of charging. Or, if possible, bring your own scooter and get rolling!", "meta": {"review_id": "g44881-d107811-r491297645", "category": "couples"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[338, 369, "Inclusion"], [589, 631, "Inclusion"], [646, 676, "Inclusion"], [711, 736, "Inclusion"]]}

Went toward the end of the day Saturday, saw some qualifying laps, very enjoyable. Walked around a bit, lots to see re racing, and lots of overpriced, but tasty food and drink. Great people watching, lots of diversity land folks from out of town and other countries. Justin Timberlake concert crazy crowded, but funfrom a distance of 200-300 yards. So race day?  Absolutely fantastic!  Sat in the bleachers at turn 12, row 18, section 6. I loved the location. Pre-race activities were okay, but the race was really, really greatthe speed, sound, passing, place changes ... all of it. I brought binoculars, really good idea as you can see some of the other turns/roadway, not just the area in front of you. Bleachers can get uncomfortable, but I had a cushion. I enjoyed the narration of the race too. Stevie Wonder? wow, wow, wow!  Paid an extra $69-79/ticket to get VIP standing room. See photos. We were 20 feet from Stevie Wonder. He put on a fabulous show! Pay the extra money to be close to performers/stage. Worth it!Some thoughts ... I paid $20 to park in someone's yard across from the handicap drop off area. Ten minute walk to the entrance, mildly uphill. Can take a pedicab for $10/person. No reason to pay $40/day to park. We were ahead of the traffic leaving. Yay!  Or can park in a nearby neighborhood and take an Uber, less than $10. You can take in a bottle of water. Do so. And refill it at a filling station. Better than $4/bottle. Only serious bad issue. The security. Pathetic. Bag check both days was a half-hearted effort. Fellow could have had his eyes closed and done as thorough a job. Today, my wife walked in an exit yes, she had a ticket, so not cheating to meet up with me as the race had ended. No one said a thing, no bag check, nothing. Major improvement in security needed.

{"id": 545, "text": "I want to state that me and my spouse are not frequent cruise people we feel claustrophobic and confined and prefer open resorts that allow us space.  Let's start with the good1. You must have a balcony.  We had a mini suite and if you can afford it. DO IT.  The bathroom alone is worth it especially if you expect more than a tight shower and a toilet.  We had a full size bathtub which my wife used.2.  Our steward Mark Bernardino.  He was excellent.  He anticipated our needs and when we had issues like a bathtub that didn't seal he had a plumber down when we were out of the room and fixed it.  This is our third cruise and he was head and shoulders above any I have experienced.3 Entertainment staff all the way up to the cruise director.  Every one was funny engaging and always made even the most mundane entertainment worthwhile.  They exceeded our expectations and if we return to cruising it will be because of the entertainment all day every day.4.  Most of the wait staff.  Here are a few exemplary ones  Nickolay at Share.  He was attentive but not intrusive.  Anton at the Explorers bar.  He lost my cruise card and helped me replace it.  He was always available for a drink and always pleasant.  Handling bad situations is the mark of great customer service and he demonstrated it.  William at The Salty Dog.  He was helpful and made suggestions on drinks.  The bar was generally slow but he was the type of old school bartender you like to sit with and have a drink.  Not all the staff was this good and I will get to that later.4.  The speciality restaurants especially the newest Share were the best meals we had.  It is too bad the dining room wasn't 5.  The all inclusive drink packages will be in all of these.  The selection of top shelf alcohol included was impressive the best I have seen even though some run out very quickly. We needed to drink 8-10 alcoholic drinks per day to break even but with measured pours and waters and sodas included and NO TIPPING. It is money well spent if you can swing it6 Kelvin the cruise director. FANTASTIC!  His attitude and willingness to do anything to help was contagious throughout the staff. Princess owes him a raise!Now the BAD1.  We have higher expectations for food and I had heard so many things about cruising and cuisine.  Well I didn't experience that.  The buffets were worse than the cheapest Vegas buffett imaginable.  After a few of them,even breakfast, I wanted to go without rather than eat.  I actually didn't gain weight.2. We had anytime seating for meals which allows flexibility but often caused a wait.  No suggestion here just be aware.  If you can reserve a time every day try to.  The food in the dining room was better than the Buffett but far from the AMR resorts we often visit.3. The restaurants that were a premium, as much as $40 dollars a person were above average but you had to pay extra.4.  The drink package.  One drink per card at a time. No doubles and they sometimes required the empty before they made the next.  The speciality drinks were the most generous.  If you want a drink of your own. BE SPECIFIC.  The Princess way is the cheapest way to make it.  They measure every pour and you will be disappointed if you aren't specific.5.  Not a lot of large venues so the timing for things always revolves around ETSY.  THE UGLY.1.  Let's start with ETSY.  They are the newest on board jewelry seller and they are relentless and aggressive.  They bait and switch and hook people into attending for raffles and FREE prizes which you wouldn't probably want anyway.2.PAUL FROM GREAT BRITAIN in the Explorers bar.  This relates back to the all inclusive drink package.  As earlier stated some made you bring the empty or take your almost empty drink from you BEFORE you could order the next watered down exactly measured drink, but Paul took it one step further.  He was at the bar facing away from the tables and he made it his job on a very busy night to watch me leave his busy bar and sit at my table!  This during a football game.  I sat my drinks down and my brother in law tried it.  Paul saw that and when I came back later he accused me of GIVING MY DRINK AWAY.  I was offended and he didn't seem to care, he proceeded to tell me that was policy and he couldn't serve me if he saw it again!  Up until this point I was annoyed by the package and the inconsistent way it was being handled but I am sure it is NOT Pauls job to be bartender and drink package security.  It left a bad taste in my mouth and is a big reason for the overall grade of 2!  I hope Pauls behavior and actions are addressed and just remember if he is large and Paul from GB. Move on!3.  Security on and off the ship were the worst from a service perspective.  I am unsure if it was needed or just a power trip but they needed to work with Kelvin to smile a bit more and be a bit more helpful.4. On ship internet is overpriced and not very good. Smallest package is $99 for 100 minutes!  Other cruise lines are much better at making this usable feature onboard.  If you have MIFI device bring it there are a number of times and places it will function.  International phone plans however are useless.We had a mixed bag of a time. The sites were great the weather not so much and the seas were a bit rough.  You take your chances on that though.  Overall know what to expect take those excursions and experience the games and activities.  Too bad a few bad experiences make this a two.  Jury is still out on cruising again.  I hope it helps", "meta": {"review_id": "g28923-d144468-r420997676", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1755, 1792, "Inclusion"], [2329, 2351, "Exclusion"], [4874, 4904, "Exclusion"]]}

There were few quiet places to stand, never mind sit and eat. The lay-out also seems pretty random, so it's hard to know where you are, or re-trace your steps to something that looked nice you saw before. Things are expensive. My wife had a Thai 'aromatic duck wrap with plum sauce', about GBP8.50, nice, pretty meaty, but expensive. I had a hot Scotch egg nice but a touch salty for me and sweet potato fries from a stall called Scotchtails. GBP6.90. If you're used to crowds and jostling etc then you might be fine here. It was a bit claustrophobic here for me this Saturday, and I reckon it might we way more chilled out, and spacious on a week-day. So that's the plan for a future visit, when we hope to have a chance to exhale, relax, and really have a chance to wonder slowly and get a better grip on what is what at this venue.ps. There was a fancy looking drinks shop/stall here - but the prices!!? A bottle of Westmalle Trappist beer, circa GBP2.20/30 at 'posh' Waitrose supermarket, was u00A33.80 here.

{"id": 561, "text": "Touring the USS Alabama was a great experience! We went early in the morning around 8:30-9am and there were no lines during any part of our visit. We only toured the battleship, not the submarine or aircraft building. Tickets were $15/person but they offer a AAA discount $13/person. We thought this was a reasonable price. The battleship is divided up into three tours, basically one of each deck. We did the top deck first for fear of impending rain and found there to be several crew members on board to answer our questions. The other two tours of the respective decks were easy to follow. There are numbered arrows to follow for each which doubles as a fun counting and color experience for the younger kids. Every area has some sort of educational information that is very short and sweet. There are a few larger information dump rooms with huge dioramas, posters, and memorabilia. Some of the ship is air conditioned but a good portion of it is not. They are able to keep the air moving pretty well in the areas without A/C but it does get pretty hot with all of the walking. EXPECT LOTS OF STAIRS. I know that is pretty much a given but I just wanted to throw that out there. Below deck the tours take you up and down SEVERAL steep and I mean steep staircases. If the spaces are tight enough I can begin to feel claustrophobic but I didn't feel that way at all on this ship. The one place I didn't go was into the engine room, so I cannot speak to how that was. Above deck the flooring was slippery due to the rain from the night before but there was a rubber mat for traction provided. The concession part of the visitor's center was the general overpriced food. Their souvenirs seemed reasonably priced.

They Don't Care About Us was strongly featured while Billie Jean was cut short?!?! Sat through show thinking what i would have done differently. Not one of the dancers could ever equal Michael, but a troupe doing some of the dances would have had a bigger effect. Trampoline jumping during Thriller was very boring. Maybe they could have done something actually thrilling or added an unexpected element. But again, thinking of ways a show could have been better during the show is very telling. I felt like the show had a strong social message with an angry Michael Jackson which is not how i remember him. Music was teeth-shakingly loud, and i've been to my fair share of loud concerts. Family next to us had ear plugs for the kids. I noticed a lot of empty seats, and i'm really sore about the amount of money we spent to see this show.

If you rely on seating plans from Ticketmaster, be very careful because these extra seat rows mean you may not get the seats you expect, and may not have the legroom you think you'll have. What is more annoying is that the extra rows were put in on the refurb, after many tickets with the old seating plan had been sold, some shows needing to be booked a year in advance.Loads of people were complaining about the audio quality for the show Dave Gorman ... parts were wholly unintelligible which was a real shame.The final bugbear is that even though the show was due to start at 8pm, doors weren't opened until almost 7:40pm and the foyer was just a crush after they had announced in the Piano Bar at 7:30pm that the theatre was open. It wasn't but everyone was trying to get in, and from the street as well.Our local theatre, the Playhouse in Weston, is so much better managed and more comfortable.

Fastpasses are issued the old way, where you need to insert your park ticket and receive a paper Fastpass that you present at the ride during the appointed time for one ride at a time.  While he was in line, the rest of the party went on Buzz Lightyear Planet Rescue, which is right next to TRON and had NO line.  The ride is similar to the one at Walt Disney World, with improved laser guns.  The lasers can be lifted out of the holsters, are green or red depending on where you are sitting in the car and the gun vibrates and lights up when a target is hit.  Two members in our group were able to score over 700,000 points.It was now about 9:15 and we went into the standby entrance for TRON. There was a minimal line and we basically just walked right on.  This ride is very cool - it is similar to Test Track at WDW, but you are on a motorcycle.  It's an amazing experience and one not to be missed.The lines were so short that we squeezed in another ride on Buzz Lightyear before our Tron FP was active.Next stop Pirates of the Caribbean.  FPs are not available for this ride.  The wait time posted was 45 minutes, but it took us less than 20 to get to the ride.  All I am going to say is that it is spectacular!! The graphics are amazing and I do not want to spoil it for anyone who is going.  We went on it twice in a row.  Get a seat up front to experience it to the max.Seven Dwarfs Mine Train is the same as WDW.  If you are short on time, skip it.Soaring Over the Horizon is now available at WDW.  FPs for this ride were gone by 10am and the line was posted as 120 minutes for the remainder of the day, but the actual wait was closer to an hour.  People who suffer from claustrophobia will not like this line up as about a third of it is in a corridor about 5' wide with 10'  walls surrounding it and it's about 30' long until you snake around the corner and find yourself in another corridor.We skipped Roaring Rapids.  Wait times were posted as 120 minutes and people getting off the ride were soaked.Peter Pan is basically the same as WDW with a few improvements.  The cars now hold 6 people and the statues seem larger.We caught the parade twice.  The floats were colourful and interesting.  People weren't waiting for them to start hours ahead like at WDW, and we were able to secure good spots almost at the last minute both times. This parade is very tight, so once it starts, you cannot cross it until it is finished.We ate at the Tangled Tree Tavern.  We were very impressed with the food.  The Sichuan chicken was two full chicken breasts with fries and was mildly spicy.  The roasted chicken was juicy and a good size and came with mashed potatoes. The Mongolian beef was a mix of beef, noodles and vegetables and was also was very tasty.  We felt it was good value.The bathrooms are plentiful and clean with a good ratio of Western and Eastern toilets. We did not experience excessive line cutting or any other unusual behaviour that some other reviewers mentioned.  Most of the time we saw no evidence of crowds and walked on to many rides with minimal wait times.Many of the staff do not speak English, however, there did seem to be at least one person everywhere we went that could.  A special shout out to Flora, a supervisor in Guest Services, who was especially helpful!We had to leave the park around 4:30pm and opted to take the Metro home to avoid the traffic.  It was very easy and cost only 6 RMB per person.  The stop at Disneyland is the last one of Metro Line 11, so there were plenty of seats.  The stops on the maps and at the stations are all listed in English and Chinese and the transfers are easy.  The station maps make it obvious which direction the subway is headed. The subway was clean, not very crowded and the people riding it were all pleasant.Tips and Tricks:Buy your tickets early on-line.  Tickets were sold out for July 3 and 5th by July 1st. Don't forget to bring your passport!If Soaring is a priority get a Fastpass asap. TRON and Buzzlightyear had minimal lines in the morning. I recommend sending a scout to get Soaring FPs while the rest of the party heads to Tommorowland.Ask to sit in the front row for Pirates of the Caribbean to get the full effect of the experience.Many of the guests were unfamiliar with the Fastpass process and arrived too early. So if you see a large line at your appointed time, just move to the front and the attendants will let you in.Take the Metro.  It's cheap, clean, safe and an extra adventure for the kids! Buy your tickets on to the way to station.  It's only about a 5 minute walk from the park.", "meta": {"review_id": "g308272-d10383031-r391000935", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[129, 167, "Inclusion"], [74, 91, "Exclusion"], [2812, 2831, "Inclusion"], [3570, 3624, "Exclusion"], [4385, 4413, "Inclusion"], [4720, 4730, "Inclusion"], [4912, 4940, "Inclusion"], [5622, 5638, "Inclusion"], [5640, 5656, "Inclusion"], [5912, 5940, "Inclusion"], [6378, 6406, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 592, "text": "My husband and I took the Rhine River Christmas market cruise from  Basel Switzerland to Amsterdam in December 2016.  My husband has limited mobility - in his case, he can walk unassisted but needs moments to stop and rest hip replacement one year ago.  The cruise itself was as expected from how Viking sells itself high end luxury type cruise.  We were assured that there were off-vessel excursions for my husband to participate in that involved very little walking.  We found this to be totally untrue.  The easy excursions still required a person to walk sometimes distances of half a mile to a bus.  I wish someone had forewarned us of this prior to making our reservation.  While i thoroughly enjoyed the cruise, my poor husband paid $5,000 to essentially sit on the vessel at each port since they don't make any accommodations for those with handicaps or limited mobility.  Yes, i read the disclaimer but was assured by the booking agent AND the employees on the vessel that the distances were short enough for even those who couldn't walk far and that they would help us - which was not true.  We hired a taxi in one location.     The cities that you visit are amazing but you need more time than what is allotted for each stop over to experience the life.  This is a great, albeit expensive, way to get a feel for the places you may want to visit in more depth in the future.  In summary, the accommodations on the vessel Viking Vidar were wonderful.  The food was overabundant and delicious.  The employees did what they could and did it well in most cases.  The tipping mentality during the daily briefings on the ship was obnoxious.  The program director got more and more 'insistent' on this as the cruise progressed.  If you have any particular questions, please feel free to contact me directly.  We had 4 people on our vessel who either walked with a cane, had bad knees or other limited mobility who all wished they had been told the truth about the distances when they inquired with specific questions during their reservation process.   I really wanted to focus this review on the mobility issue more than anything else.

I am not usually one to leave overly positive reviews but this place is incredible!We only visited by chance as we have a National Trust membership and wanted to start using it more often, we had never heard if the place or even knew anything about it, just literally went on the NT app and picked somewhere. The app doesn't even go into any detail about what's available here for kids.Anyway, everything from the second you drive into the grounds is brilliant. Everything is modern, clean, upkept, well sign posted and there's a lot of staff around to help! We got a map at reception and we're so shocked to find out there's an outdoor adventure park, indoor play area AND maze all for children, as well as the usual grounds and house etc.... We had 3 hours to visit which is usually more than enough time to see everything, especially with young children who get fed up quickly. But we literally spent the WHOLE 3 hours just in the adventure playground. There is literally somethingnfor every age child and it's massive, it goes on forever your kids will never get bored! The equipment is so well maintained and up to date. Nothing is broken or under maintainence, lots of hidden gem in the park you wouldn't expect such as different water play areas, carved chairs inside tree stumps, play equipment that makes sounds/squirts water just by plays on them. Also, a real miniature steam train ride which you do have to pay for separately at u00A31.50 each.I cannot wait to return as soon as we are able to and explore the rest of the grounds and maze/indoor play area. If you don't have a National Trust membership it does feel very pricey but it's worth buying one just for this park alone!! My one negative is that there wasn't only 1 bin in the whole park meaning I had to carry loads of rubbish around with me. Couldn't see one near any of the seating areas and people were just leaving their coffee cups on th picnic tables.Overall, best park we've ever been to!

Hotel NEVER CLEARED THE ICE-CAKED STEPS three sets of them the ENTIRE time we were there.Truly scary Hotel room was large and the sauna was great, HOWEVER, upon opening the toilet first thing was greeted by a horrendous mess of poo/splatters. I cleaned it after a glass. Black hairs in shower, not ours. Yuck! Food in hotel not a la carte is awful at best. Found hairs in my pasta. We ate out after 2nd day. A la carte was good, not the Michelin star promised. Also, it was the same menu every day.Breakfast was same every day, bread was always fresh and tasty, cold scrambled eggs and oily bacon. They take away the breakfast dishes INCLUDING THE COFFEE at 10 am exactly, even if some people are showing up a bit late. Problems with WIFI in hotel--sporadic and had to constantly sign in. Birmingham airport couldn't handle snow unlike the Fins and we sat in lobby awaiting updates on return flight from TUI the entire day. Next day, TUI moves us to very crowded small Rovaniemi airport at which we waited a very miserable claustrophobic day as well. Felt sorry for the children. TUI distributes letter on the plane saying we were only delayed 27 hours. Hmmmmmm. Me thinks, NOT. Even worse was arriving late evening second day to Birmingham Airport, Swissport staff did not bring our suitcases in for three long hours told us they were ordered to unload expensive trips first, all-inclusive last, in which time, all the young children lots! went maniacal with behaviour all over the baggage area, screaming, running about on the conveyor belts. Next, was the exciting adventure of clearing all the ice off the car . . . fascinating. Home never looked so good. We took two trips in Lapland, one to the Wildlife Park polar bears sensational. Be prepared for a LOT OF WALKING, but you could always sit down and rest occasionally. Loved the huskie sledding. Great fun!

We walked there from The Warwick on a gorgeous October morning, and our breath was taken away by the architecture of the Hamilton building when we arrived. Wow! What a treat to see it in person!Although we were a bit disappointed that the top floor of the building was closed to install an upcoming  exhibit, and another section was closed to install an exhibit about the costumes used in Star Wars well, I'm more of a Star Trek person anyway, we still found a lot to admire about the collection on display.We started in the Hamilton building, then saw the North building from the top floor down.The Hamilton building had a lot of odd spaces of course but the artwork was beautifully presented. My favorite pieces were Zeng Fanzhi'sSeries No. 10u201D, and Gene Davis' ginormousTattoou201D in the auditorium.Be sure to check out the sculpture garden on the third floor patio for some vertigo-inducing spaces. By the way, that row of stainless steel boxes just outside the door is not part of the mechanics of the buildingit's a piece of art by Donald Judd!Navigating the North building is a bit awkward because there is no central stairway to move between floors. Most everyone waited for the elevators, but we discovered a stairwell off to the side near the restrooms / elevators on each floor. You'll get around much faster using the stairs ... that's why you'll want to start on the top floor after the elevator up.I wasn't quite as impressed with the art in the North building. I'm just not all that interested in western American art cowboys, etc, American Indian art, Asian art, fashion and textiles, etcbut they did have one spectacular painting that made the trip to the North building worth it. It was Christian Rex van Minnen'sJellyfish Fryu201D. Wow! We don't have children but I appreciated that there are play areas on each floor where parents can take the little ones to distract them when they get unrulyand they may even learn something while there. Each floor also had kind of a lounge where you'd find lots of books, art, big comfy chairs and couches, and a variety of things to keep you interested if you wanted to investigate the subjects in the galleries a bit deeper.Palettes, the restaurant, is located on the ground floor of the North building, and it's a great spot for lunch see the separate review. There is a gift shop geared towards kids near Palettes restaurant, and a much larger gift shop in the Hamilton building where you purchase tickets for the museum.

So, check by phone before parking and walking in for tickets. Even though my kids ages 12 and 10 had a blast, it took about 45 minutes to find a spot to sit. At times it felt claustrophobic. It is very loud in there, but that's kind of to be expected in a place like that. Not a very relaxing environment. If you want to relax, then go to the adult pool area. It goes outside and you can get a little break from all the noise. Plus, its not as crowded over that way. The service at the bars was really slow and the staff didn't seem to really care how long you waited. Which is annoying when one beer costs around $5. We paid for the body boarding lessons and the kids had fun. Make sure they wear a shirt if you have girls. The water rushes at them and their suits could fall off. The rooms were really nice. Try for the suite - it didn't cost us much more than the normal room and it was a lot more roomy than the standard rooms. Housekeeping is great. They're very friendly and courteous.

{"id": 630, "text": "We visited during mid-May and this turned out to be a good time to visit.  While the schedule was still somewhat reduced from the full summer operation, there were no real lines for the buildings we visited.  We did run into what seemed to be some school groups but this was not too much of an impact.  This schedule was in effect from April 28 through June 15.  The historic area was still very well maintained and there were some new exhibit areas since two years ago.  The staff were very knowledgeable and were happy to pass on their knowledge in an interesting manner.  I would suggest planning to spend several days here and to buy an annual ticket which lets you in the attractions for one year from date of purchase.  That way you do not feel rushed to try to see all of the exhibit areas and to attend the events that are of interest to you.  This is especially important if there are overlaps between multiple things you want to see.  As many of the special presentations occur more than once in a week, you have more of a chance to see all that you want to.  And you can take breaks to go to other attractions and then get back in Williamsburg another day.We stayed in a resort within walking distance of the historic area and by doing this we could walk back to the unit when we wanted to and return when we wanted to.  While we were there the weather was not always very spring-like.  We had a couple of days when the temperature was around 91-92 degrees with a feels like temperature of 99 degrees.  We could take breaks in our unit to cool off.  And this was in mid May!One thing to consider is that the buildings are accurate to the period and thus have minimal accommodations for the disabled.  We traveled with a person who needed a walker and this limited what she could take part in.  The Palace had a lift not very visible to get her to the main floor but she had to wait there while we went to the second floor.  The courthouse had no provisions at all which was more the case due to the authenticity of the buildings so she had to make it up the stairs to the entrance.  However, they let us stay in the courthouse when they cleared everybody out to then let people in line in to see the mock trials.  So the staff were doing their best to accommodate her needs but were limited as there was no modifications in most cases to accommodate the handicapped in the historic area so that the buildings can be authentic.  Bassett Hall had a ramp to the initial visitor area where a movie is shown which used to be a garage but not in the house itself.  For the house there was one ramp from the rear into the kitchen but that is where the normal tour ends and there was no way to get to the second floor.  For some other buildings the staff brought her materials describing what we were going to see to look at while we were in the building.Outside the historic area such as the visitors center, Bruton Parish church, and the museum had ramps or elevators when needed but generally not in the historic area.  When we were there the museum was undergoing an expansion limiting some of the exhibits.  And Bruton Parish Church was replacing their organ so any organ presentations had to be done elsewhere.", "meta": {"review_id": "g58313-d102549-r679241310", "category": "couples"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[153, 177, "Inclusion"], [1665, 1709, "Exclusion"], [1762, 1802, "Exclusion"], [2305, 2376, "Exclusion"], [2943, 2972, "Inclusion"]]}

I say some trepidation as we are not the best sailors and can recall bad experiences on the old cross-channel ferries in our youth.  We were also a bit worried by some of the negative reviews here on TA.Impressions of the port at Weymouth were not very good - the facilities looked pretty run-down to me.  Loading took quite a while of moving forward a little then waiting a few minutes, then moving again... Eventually we were on board with our little car squashed into a rather claustrophobic tight spot at the front of the ferry with just enough room to get out the car.  Once in the passenger area, we were however very pleasantly surprised by how bright and open the accommodation was.  Also a nice welcome from the cabin services manager who directed us to our seats.  As it wasn't full we were able to move to alternative seats during the voyage mainly to avoid the bright sunlight streaming through the window.  Our standard seats were comfortable - similar to an aircraft but in a much more spacious and airy cabin.The out-bound trip was very calm and we were able to move around the boat taking advantage of the reasonable duty free prices in the shop and some sandwiches and drinks from the", "meta": {"review_id": "g190727-d4232261-r200570666", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[744, 776, "Exclusion"]]}

I have had uneventful rides being on time, sometimes somewhat late and on one occasion a terrible snow storm made us about 11 hours late and Amtrak put us up in hotels in Chicago and we had to catch the next connecting train the next day.  That sort of became an adventure.  Amtrak is often late.  Plan on that happening.  The biggest problem is missing a connecting train.On the other hand, I think it is SO MUCH BETTER to take the train than to hassle driving across the country.  No driving hassles, especially in winter.  I have gone coach and used the sleeper cars.  The sleepers are great and the meals come with it.  You can have privacy in the sleeper car or you can go to the viewing car for a change of pace.  You get all the coffee and orange juice in your car in the morning.  Water bottles are always available.  The attendants I have had have been friendly.  The bathrooms are not as heavily used in the sleeper cars and generally cleaner.  Some rooms have private bathrooms.The waiters/waitresses in the dining car have always been more than pleasant with me.  I think the food is mostly good.  I am gluten free and I still manage.  It is rather expensive if buying it as a coach passenger.I find it difficult to sleep in the coach cars.  The seats don't recline quite as much as I would like for sleeping purposes.  Bring a small pillow and a blanket.  Sometimes the A/C can be too cold in the summer at night.  The coach cars have more disturbances than the sleeper cars.  Sometimes little kids make noise.  You are surrounded by people.  Most people are considerate but once in a while there is someone who causes problems.  I found that to be rare.  You meet more people when you ride coach because it is not as private.When you buy the sleeper you are basically buying a little rolling hotel room, your meals, and other perks.  When you buy coach you are basically buying a chair space, no meals, no perks.Sleeper cars are separated from the coach cars by the viewing car and the dining car to keep traffic away from the sleeper cars.Cafe car - everybody buys the stuff they want.  Prices are high.  They have snacks, little pizzas, soft drinks, alcohol, typical goods.  I have always felt safe on the train.  The scenery is wonderful on this train.  From majestic mountains Colorado Rockies and the Sierra Nevada in California to the wide open spaces and deserts you are able to see the changing landscape across the country.If you MUST get to your destination at a certain time be careful to allow some extra time just in case.

All the stalls are open on Friday and Saturday, the main market days, but there are some permanent stalls during the rest of the week.If you're in London staying at an apartment or house VRBO, HomeAway or Airbnb type accommodation then I recommend paying a visit on a Friday it will be less busy than Saturday to stock up on lots of lovely fresh organic produce, artisan breads, etc. It's not an early morning market - arriving at 9 is perfectly reasonable and things won't get busy until after 10am usually, even on a Saturday.If you are staying at a hotel and can't do any food shopping, then arrive around 11.45 for an early lunch stuff will get very busy, even on a Friday and visit one of the hot food stands for lunch.  You can even get a glass of prosecco or champagne or spiced mulled wine in the winter and walk around, sampling bits of comte cheese, speck, etc. I'm vegan and there are lots of vegan options too - fantastic juice bars, a couple bakeries which do great vegan cake options, and  V Burger which does a gorgeous range of vegan burgers.There are plenty of nice souvenirs to buy too, some artisan wares and jellies, jams, chutneys, packaged cheeses, etc which you can take home with you too.Unless you are just not a foodie person at all, then set aside an hour or so to visit this gorgeous market.

{"id": 744, "text": "My husband and I visited Cheddar Gorge yesterday and had heard there was a walk that you could do all around the sides of the Gorge.  At the slightly lower ticket information booth on the left the only way to do this walk and the 274 steps up the Jacobs Ladder was by paying 19.95 for a ticket which included other things that we weren't interested in.  We were disappointed so carried on driving up the hill and parked in the 5 pounds all day parking opposite the higher ticket office on the right.Here we were sold two tickets to do the Gorge Walk and walk the 274 steps to the lookout tower for 5.50 each.  We set off up the steps and up the tower which had an excellent view of the surrounding area.  We immediately noticed that we were the only people walking in our direction and that everyone else was doing the walk the other way around.  Why we wondered.  We soon found out why.  We were told that if you do the walk in the other direction it is free as there is no-one at any of the other entry/exit points, only at the one we entered at.  And that at the one we entered at you can exit for free through the No Entry turn style.Now I don't mind paying for a good days entertainment and I know it must cost money to upkeep the stairs and the tower, but it really sticks in your throat when you are the ONLY people who have paid and everyone else has had the exact same experience totally for free.  You are left feeling like a mug who has been taken for a ride.My other gripe is the sign posting.  It is excellent on the return journey which is the outward journey to sensible people! there are regular sign posts on what is quite clearly sign posted a National Trust Walk.  We had no issues on the way back.  On the first leg from the lookout tower however, we found that the map provided had woefully inadequate directions and that there were no sign posts.  We saw the lookout on the left on the map but never did see the one on the right.  Things got really tricky at the point where you have to go over a style and then not go on the other side of the stock fence.  This meant not going through a gate.  The instructions were poor and the sign posting non existent so we wandered around up there for half an hour until we decided to go through the gate after all.  On the other side of the gate was a huge sign for the Cheddar Gorge Walk.  So the people coming in the opposite direction for free were not getting lost at this rather tricky section yet the people who had paid were!  Talk about adding insult to injury!That said it was a lovely walk with amazingly dramatic scenery which we thoroughly enjoyed.  The weather was beautiful and we got to see ponies and goats. So please make it fair for everyone so people don't feel ripped off.  I'm all for paying for entertainment and would happily have paid my 5.50 if everyone else up there had as well.  Lock the metal turn style at the bottom of Jacobs ladder so people can't exit that way for free or station a person there to collect their 5.50.  Our car was right opposite the turn style so while we ate our picnic in the car we saw dozens of walkers exiting the turn style for free.  It is clearly marked No Entry - Start the walk from the Shop, so either make it No Exit - Leave the walk through the shop as well and charge people.To start the walk for free, you simply continue up the road with the ticket office on your right and in a couple of hundred yards there is a lane on your left.  Turn up the lane and just passed a few houses you will see clear sign posting to National Trust Cheddar Gorge Walk.", "meta": {"review_id": "g186371-d212457-r370125875", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[3564, 3576, "Nothing"]]}

The countries were very uniquely decorated and the brick walkways were cool.-there was lots of shaded areas and places to sit.-free water and refills all day if you bought the souvenir cup-animals throughout the park were cool to see. -they have some good coasters if that's your thing. If not, there isn't a whole lot left to do. Our 13 year old isn't a coaster person. I was hoping there would be more shows, etc for her to enjoy. Cons:-we waited 45 minutes just to pay for parking. That was insane. They need more attendants. -No cubbies to hold loose articles on rides. You are forced to rent a locker. They do have lockers all around the park and for a $8 fee you can move your items from locker to locker as you move around the park. But in my opinion this sucked. We bought souvenir cups and then could not bring them with us to stay hydrated while waiting in long lines. -food was not that good. Mass chaos at food courts, no organization. Slooooooow workers. We expected at least one nice table service restaurant, but didn't find one. Disappointing. Yes it's country themed, but don't expect anywhere near the level of world showcase at Epcot or you will be greatly disappointed!-the park is very spread out, so prepare for tons of walking. We felt there were not enough signs pointing us which way to go, especially for specific rides.-I had looked forward to seeing the Celtic Fire show, only to find out there were no showtimes the day we went. Rides we most enjoyed: Apollo's Chariot. Very little wait and a very smooth and enjoyable coaster!!Verbolten. Waited a while, but worth it. VERY cool and very scary coaster!

{"id": 811, "text": "Travelling to Canterbury for the day, we decided to extend the visit and take in the cathedral, having always bypassed it before.  February is a quieter time as one believes the crowds are heaving during summer.Having overcome the quite high parking charges nearby, u00A31.60 per hour, the charge to get into the cathedral was a bit eyebrow-raising, even with the seniors discount down to u00A310.50 each.  I suppose It is probably comparable to other major sites - and it desperately in need of funds for restoration.I know it is old but as the principal church of the Anglican Church worldwide, it was quite shocking to see the degree of corrosive weathering damage to the structure and one wonders how it has been allowed to deteriorate to quite such an extent. It is a World Heritage Site and fund-raising appeals are ongoing but there is no state funding nor from the Church of England. One imagines there is a long way to go. Major scaffolding is erected inside and out notably at the western front and nave and clearly some parts of the south and east sides have benefitted from major restoration already. So it is pleasing that work is taking place. Sadly of course, it rather spoils the appearance and the photos but it is absolutely necessary.The Crypt below is noticeable for its different Norman style and the St Gabriel Chapel has 800 year old Christian wall paintings.  The stained glass windows are spectacular.

{"id": 818, "text": "We travelled the first week in September and drove the route in our MX5, topless most of the route, taking 5 days. We pre-planned the clockwise route from Inverness and booked bed and breakfast establishments before our holiday, don't hope to find accommodation along the way as we saw lots of No vacancy signs. However, if we did the route again we would probably do less miles each day, visit more attractions, and take more time. We were quite lucky with the weather and ended up with only two midge bites. Our favourite part was the whole of the west coast but we particularly liked the Gairloch area. We stayed at Lochcarron, Laide,Tongue and Lybster. Our intended attractions were; 1.Strathpeffer were we watched the salmon leaping- a 5 minute walk from the free car park and a 10 minute uphill walk back. We stayed that night at Pathend BB  Lochcarron and enjoyed an excellent evening meal and breakfast there. 2.Gairloch harbour, we intended taking the Marine Life Centre 2 hour boat trip to see whales/dolphins etc- sadly this was cancelled due to high winds at sea. Or the Gairloch Treking Centre horse ride on a nearby beach which with hindsight wasn't a good idea for a novice rider who needed to sit on his bottom while driving for the rest of the week. Instead we had lunch at Gairloch harbour cafe and then a walk on the lovely Mellon Udrigle beach near Laide, we ate a delicious evening meal in the Convoy Bar at  Aultbeau Hotel. Our overnight stay at the Lovecroft BB was choose for its clifftop rural location, hopefully to see a sky full of stars. We were not disappointed and had a fantastic display, including shooting stars. The next morning Stephen Love made us a very good breakfast, despite having to run after his sheep half way through. This new little house on a old croft was our favourite overnight stop. We next drove from Laide to Tongue and the scenery changes every hour from coast to mountains, quite spectacular. 3.The Pie shop at Lochinver, we made the mistake of sitting in at lunchtime as it had started to drizzle, this proved quite expensive and too filling. Our tip is grab a pie and eat outside unless you can make the stop your evening meal, however, not sure what time it closes. Unfortunately, we stayed at the Ben Loyal Hotel in Tongue that night, it was the most expensive and the worst BB we have ever stayed in, it  is overpriced and run by a complacent Manageress, we DO NOT recommend. The scenery on our next part of the trip was not as good. 4.Visited the Rock Rose Gin Distillery but sadly they were filming in the distillery and we could not go in, instead we were entertained by a very informative young lady who let us have a sip of some of their award winning Gin. What did we buy from there? VODKA of course and it is very good. 5. Visited next Castle of Mey, holiday home of the Queen Mother. We did actually get in here and enjoyed a guided tour around her home which Prince Charles still visits.However, It started to rain really hard while there and it spoilt our views of the coast and a walk to her farm. We did enjoy a delicious brew and cakes in the tea rooms though. 6. John o'Groats was disappointing perhaps due to the rain but we did enjoy an Ice-cream at Flavours Ice Cream Parlour and bought some souvenirs and took the obligatory photos. 7. Intended going on the Pentland Safari speed boat trip or the Wildlife Boat Geo Explorer at Wick but the rain was getting heavier so we had to give it a miss. The rest of the trip down the east coast was a bit disappointing after the spectacular west coast. The route from Lochcarron to Tongue was our favourite. The most tricky bit of road is probably Bealach na Ba but we expected this. Yes you do get a lot of motor homes on the road but they usually pull into a passing place to let faster traffic past. You should do likewise for the poor locals going about their daily business.There were not as many motorbikes as I  expected or cyclists usually seen on foot pushing their bikes up steep hills-not my idea of fun- but to be fair it is known as one of the most strenuous cycle routes. The North Coast 500 was a good experience and opened up areas that we would like to re-visit. Do your research before you go and don't expect any sign posts for NC500.

{"id": 836, "text": "The Hoover Dam is located near the town of Boulder City which is about 45 minutes by car from Las Vegas. Boulder City has most services and is the base for Lake Mead a popular tourist destination in its own right. Being the adventurous types we rented a car and doubled down for a full day of 118 degree heat, desert, Hoover Dam and Eldorado Mine In Nelson NV a half hour to the south of Boulder City. That's 48 degrees you metric fans. Take lots of water no matter what time of year you decide to go and a fully charged cell phone. It could save your life. The cost for the power plant tour down inside the dam was $15.00 for adults and $12.00for kids up to 16 yrs. The full Hoover Dam tour with extended underground passages is regularly $30, but contrary to their web site, was not running when we visited. Call ahead to avoid disappointment if the full tour isn't running. They told me after July 21st it should be going again. The full tour is 1st come 1st served and sells out by 1pm every day, so go first thing in the am if you're intent on it.  Both tours included admission to the interpretive centers. The power plant tour is able to be purchased in advance and is just that, an elevator ride down to a corridor that goes to an observation balcony overlooking the power turbines for the dam. It lasts about 25 minutes and people with pacemakers are prohibited from going. The full tour is the power plant plus a couple of other areas inside the dam and takes closer to an hour.The parking garage on the NV side of the dam is $10 to park. Skip this, drive across the dam to the AZ side and park for free in one of the convenient paved lots there. It might add 200 yards of walking onto your day.This is my 2nd time to hoover dam and I brought the kids this time. Its about a 2-3 hour experience by the time you do your tour and walk around at your leisure across the dam. There are plenty of water fountains and rest room opportunities. The main gift shop has a cafu00E9, so you can even find a snack if need be.There is a secondary attraction that requires a modest hike up a paved sidewalk to the Pat Tillman / Hoover Bypass Bridge which actually gets you the better phot spot of Hoover Dam, so don't miss that. It's the small parking lot to the right just after the guard shack at the main gate and only takes about 15 minutes to walk to a perfect photo spot.I highly recommend doing the Hoover Dam early close to opening as the highway can get super busy by mid day. We left about noon and cars were lined up for about 2 miles just to get in thru the gate. The parkade was full. If you go early enough you can cram in a tour at the Eldorado Canyon Mine about 20 min south of Boulder City. The last tour there is 2pm and was the highlight of our trip.

My family made a four hour trip to visit the park expecting to pay at most $30 per person as advertised online.  We called and because my father is a veteran and I'm in a wheelchair we were advised to pay at the gate so we could take advantage of their discounted tickets.  We were pretty excited because it was very cold so I could only be at the park for a couple hours safely. When we got to the gate at Christmas Town it was a completely different story.  We were shown to handicapped parking, but the promised ticket prices were no where to be found.  They charged us $216 for 4 adult tickets and even though we asked several different employees all swore there were no military or disability discounts available.  We didn't want to ruin the trip so we paid and went in, but it was so disappointing given that we'd called ahead.  We called the company to let them know what happened and they told us we should have purchased the tickets online for the $30 price or gone to the Busch Garden Gate if we wanted their special rates for disabled customers something they had not told us before hand, and that they had no idea why the Christmas Town Gate hadn't honored the military discount, but that we'd have to call them directly and convince them to give us our 10% back.

{"id": 883, "text": "After spending a week on both coasts of central Florida, my family of four two teen daughters all agree that Discovery Cove is the best attraction in all of Florida!  We've been to Florida many times, and DC is amazing!If you buy the multi-park pass, you will actually save money!  We went to Busch Gardens, Seaworld twice, and Discovery Cove.  With parking, the two parks w/o Discovery Cove would cost $255pp plus $75 in parking!  These tickets paid for themselves.  And you have two weeks to go to the other parks unlimited.We went on the dolphin experience because the American Humane national humane organization has certified all Seaworld properties as taking good care of their animals.  I'm torn on their breeding dolphins in captivity, but they do have a nice program.  My family was so moved by the experience.  My daughter who is afraid of marine animals actually kissed and rode with a dolphin, and it made me weepy.My husband enjoyed the snorkeling best aside from the dolphins; my girls and I the lazy river which we did four times!  We always put the noodles back after using them because as other reviewers pointed out, they are for the river and not personal use.  My favorite part was seeing the aviary from the river.The food was awesome.  So much to eat!  We were stuffed all day!  It was so fun to feel like we could grab a snack and drink whenever we wanted!  If the buffets at breakfast and lunch hadn't filled me up so much, I would have eaten so many pretzels!  And my daughters wanted slushies about three times.  Three of us are vegetarians, and we had no problem with getting food.  I requested three veggie burgers before getting in line for lunch, and the cook was super nice & watched out for us.They should have a policy against chair savings - it's ridiculous because nobody even uses them.  They are all empty with towels on top.  We didn't have time to sit down because we had too much fun.We arrived at 8am, and were through both the check-in and breakfast lines within thirty minutes.  The lines look and feel long, but if you time yourself you'll see they actually go super fast.  All adults need ID.  We spent the whole day there before going across the street to enjoy Seaworld for the rest of the evening.We used the wetsuit vests, and they helped us not to get sunburn as well as kept us warm.  I was surprised they required wetsuits everywhere - they wouldn't let my daughter go into the otter viewing or lazy river w/o them.It is soooo easy to go when you don't have to pack much.  They provided all you can eat food and drinks, lockers, snorkel gear which didn't work great otherwise I'd have done that more, fish-safe suntan lotion which worked fine for us - no burning, wetsuits, and fully stocked showers and towels.  After some reviews I was surprised that the staff are amazing!  Every single person was happy and helpful.  I think you get whatever you put out in the world.  Smile and be nice - these are hard working normal people who will treat you kindly if you are doing the same.  I noticed my daughter had lost her multi-park pass upon leaving, and a staff just printed her a new one so we didn't have to run around the park looking for it!TIPS:  don't bring your own towels; don't worry about having to be there at 6:45am but do arrive by 8am so you can use the full day; use their suntan lotion as often as you need but don't use your own harmful stuff; return noodles after going on the lazy river; don't take seats you aren't sitting in; eat plentiful and generously; don't get drunk - this is a family park; bring a change of clothes and shower there if you want to go out afterwards  Seaworld is across the street, and they have bags for your wet clothes.Thanks for a wonderful day Discovery Cove!", "meta": {"review_id": "g34515-d110173-r667228484", "category": "time_of_day"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1235, 1255, "Inclusion"], [1258, 1272, "Inclusion"], [1539, 1607, "Inclusion"], [1947, 2019, "Inclusion"], [2052, 2115, "Inclusion"], [2022, 2050, "Exclusion"], [3546, 3567, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 892, "text": "Spent the afternoon here today and just had to take the opportunity to review. First off, I had a toddler with me and brought my stroller to transport her and for napping. Upon arrival at the base of the mountain I discover no access to the gondola from the bus loop ?. We had to walk through a huge parking lot, meaning at least 20 people got ahead of us in line. Then, as the line went down a flight of stairs, we had to stand and wait to take a spot in line causing much scorn from impatient tourists who don't understand that we are not butting in line. No attendant there manning the line to help people with their myriad of questions. Was told on the phone I could pick up my tickets at the booth, when I asked for them to be mailed. It turns out you have to wait in a long line to do this, so why was it suggested I not receive the tickets by mail? Booking tickets online also preauthorized funds more than once without issueing tickets, meaning I had to wait several days to receive my money back on my card. Was told this happens often!Gondola was stuffed and no effort was put into allowing disabled or elderly to access the small amount of seating. Adults pushed children out of the way to be able to film the ride up. When we arrive, there are no maps or signs. We follow the bear paws as instructed to a grizzly bear habitat. The bear prints lead to a restaurant. When a show gets out a river of people come down the path. The movement of large amounts of people is totally unmanaged here. Although you are in the wilderness, the people are all smushed together in insdequate paths. There is no natural space to just play ot relax in. It is crowded. My kids just wanted to enjoy the natural space, but paths had steep drop offs that were unmarked and overcrowded, so I had to hold their hands during most of the visit. The Lupin cafe had a line up that had been marked of with lines that were so narrow I couldn't fit through. One section was up aginst the counter and was so narrow anyone coming through with a tray meant everyone in front of them had to leave the line. People were wearing hiking backpacls on this line. The shows were so crowded we could not find a seat or a place to stand and watch. The gondola ride down to escape seems like a good chance for us to have a view finally, when the last people on wedged themselves in front of my little kids so they could film the ride down. My children stood in the middle of the gondola surrounded by adults at windows and baclpacks in their faces.The bathroom at the base of the mountain is not accessible to strollers, so I had to leave my children alone outside while I used the restroom.In summary: this is a disappointing tourist trap that causes greedy, self centred behavior from visitors due to high prices, and expectations of a great view and experience that does not pay off. Poor people flow and amenity design mean people are overpacked in most spaces and the safety and accessibility of facilities are not adequately considered for an attraction this size.", "meta": {"review_id": "g181717-d156264-r611322809", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1160, 1197, "Exclusion"], [1648, 1661, "Exclusion"], [1764, 1775, "Exclusion"], [2136, 2161, "Exclusion"], [2558, 2588, "Exclusion"], [2765, 2783, "Exclusion"], [2897, 2918, "Exclusion"]]}

If you are reading this I hope you look up Abu Simbel and add that to your itinerary as that was one of the best bits of Egypt ...Our Luxor Cruise ship and guide on the cruise ship were not the best. I was traveling with my father who is a senior and  with age people slow down a bit at times. And I found the guide to be rather inconsiderate regarding this we felt rushed and no help with steep stairs when boarding/de boarding cruise etc. It was a small group and our co passengers were amazingly kind so everything worked out for us. If you are traveling with a senior parent or are a senior yourself perhaps let your trip planner know ahead of time. In Jordan we faced two issues related to planning. The Jordan portion is a tie up with another company ... For some reason our travel planner with Memphis Tour kept our Petra-Wadi Run trip for the last day and it was a bit stressful with all the driving and a flight to catch that night. If you are in Jordan for two full days like we were I'd suggest you finish Petra and Wadi Rum on day 1. I would have still given Memphis yours a 5 star but for a huge error on their part that could have messed up our entire trip last minute. At Amman airport we found out that since my father is an Indian citizen the flight we had via Canada required him to have a Canadian transit visa. We were able to negotiate direct flights to the US but I'm surprised that the trip planner from Memphis tour did not inform us that Canadian visa would be required by Indian citizens said he didn't know but really that's very unprofessional and if there was a direct flight available why didn't he give us that option at all?I hope they take the feedback in the right spirit and improve their service.", "meta": {"review_id": "g294201-d1547186-r738506381", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1948, 1958, "Nothing"]]}

My family was me my husband my 35mth girl my brother in law his wife there 5 mth baby my 73yr father in law my nieces 13yr. We found the toilets in shop dirty. Then bridge walk way missing screws full of rust. We arrived at base camp it was a pleasant morning. We queued for 25min to get coffee which was disgusting the lids were wrong size for cups. We ate the sausage rolls were made with pink paste. We decided to go on the safari first I read on board you could stay on trucks. We sat on truck man said it will take 35min. See animals. No safety information given apart from hit red button. We left our prams at buggy park. The seats were wooden. We started off OK as was getting colder wind blowing. Not many animals road was rough yes we had our seatbelts on and was steep vertical hills. We arrived at top told to get off and queue again for another truck I said you never said this to man you have to get off we had queued for forty minutes at base camp. It was like the the worst time we had no blankets with us for children people were shivering with cold people queueing were all saying how terrible it was. We had to endure another thirty minutes to get back no animals were seen we could of got off to see cats but state on. Now we just wanted to leave but as brother in law diabetic he got crepe from shop as cafe was queues I went to toilet they were overflowing the toilets in shop were flooded!. Now the weather you can't control but you can do something else you can advise that yes you do have to get off at top not to go on if you have back problems or mobility ones that you advise people with babies have you food nappies with you as you could be a while and that yes make sure you take warm clothing as truck drivers would know it was could that you provided adquete seat belts that work! The safari is very unsafe from this point no care was given to safety and my opinion dangerous I would not recommended this for babies as no proper clean provision provided the staff are understaffed. My brother in law have been up all night after eating at your facilities throwing up. My daughter was crying screaming to get off safari trucks as was cold and making her sick this is appalling place we would never set foot here again and is terrible pathways for disabled people the zoos are so different howletts lovely wonderful facilities staff gold stars the port lymphe was atrocity beyond belief when even your staff stand around and shrug there shoulders when you say that there are problems and staff moan that they can't cope then it needs looking at . when you advertising animals a wonderful experience so on you should put safety first install proper seat belts with adjusted ones for children give out safety instruction. Yes you have a big board by the safari but like my brother in law is dislexec is not much use you need more staff at cafes more toilets , you take your luck with animals. That is fine but to put safety of people that's not acceptable. I will be calling the zoo to inform them but put your money in your pockets and go howletts if you have young children disabled people or older people that way you might have a pleasant time for us was horrific Easter Monday !!!!!

{"id": 921, "text": "We took our family of 5 which includes 3 boys ages 10, 12 & 14 to see this show and it was a great time.  The show was age-appropriate for a wide variety and held the kids attention throughout.  The dinner was good - I won't say excellent - but good.  With kids, it would have been nice to have an option more suited to them as they are picky but they got enough - not enough to justify the cost, but enough they weren't starving.The only complaint I have is they way you line up and wait to get in.  Seats are assigned, so you really don't NEED to be there early, yet you do if you want to have plenty of time to eat.  You will wait in the lobby/gift shop area in a massive herd. It's crowded, you bump into other people and the stuff on display for sale and if you're even the least bit claustrophobic, you will not enjoy it.  They then make you get your picture taken before you get in so they can later come around and bother you to sell it to you for an outrageous price.  This was really irritating.  I am disgusted by the waste they go thru for those who don't want to buy.  It would be much more effective to have a photo spot for anyone who actually wants it.  By the time you weed out the waste of those who don't, I think you'd come out close to ahead.Once you get in, you are ushered to your table and a server brings you all of your food and drink pretty much immediately.  The one thing we found strange maybe because we're from WI?! is they bring you a bucket of pulled BBQ pork, but nothing to eat it on.  We got dinner rolls right away but those were long gone by the time the pork came out.  We don't eat pulled pork just plain by itself, seemed odd.  I'll spare the rest of the menu because you can find those details on their website or in 1000 other reviews.  However, I can tell you the servers run their tails off.  They move quickly and have a lot to do.  You are expected to tip them which they certainly earn/deserve - but make sure you know this and have cash on you.  We didn't see anything advertised about gratuity and when you pay $50+ for a dinner show ticket, you don't expect to be asked for more cash, which we don't always carry.

{"id": 931, "text": "We booked a SNUBA session at the park through Delta Travel.  The park was only a couple miles from our resort, Secrets, but that's another review.  In case you haven't heard about it, SNUBA is a way for someone who has never scuba dove to see what it is like without having to wear all the heavy scuba gear.  I am a scuba diver but my wife is not but loves to snorkel.  Victor was our Dive Master and helped us with the little bit of gear that you need to wear.  This consisted of a strap to hold the air hose and a weight belt.  So what is SNUBA?  With SNUBA, your air tank is on a raft and there are 25 foot hoses with a breathing regulator on each one.  The hose is attached to the strap you are wearing so you can tow the raft around.  You wear a face mask and fins just like scuba or snorkeling and the weights help you sink.  You breath air just like a scuba diver.  My wife was very nervous because she is a little claustrophobic and was afraid she would not be able to go under water.  I didn't think the briefing we got was very thorough for a non-diver but evidently it was good enough.  So we started in just a few feet of water so she could see what it was like to breath.  She was surprised to find it was very easy.  We then started moving into deeper water.  She did fine down to about 15 feet and was able to clear her ears.  I was the one who caused the problem when I pointed up so she could see how deep we were.  This caused her to panic a little and we had to go up.  Victor was very good about assuring her everything was ok and we started down again.  This time Victor held her hand and I pulled the raft.  She was able to go down to about 20 feet before calling it quits.  She decided that diving was not her thing and was content at helping to push the raft while watching Victor and I finish the dive. The SNUBA experience was exactly what we expected.  My wife conquered a fear and was able to see some marine life up close.  She now understands what it is like to a point when I am diving.  The whole time we were down, Victor was taking pictures and video of the dive.  The pictures and video were made available to us, for a cost of course, at the end of the dive.  I thought the briefing could have been a little more in depth.  Fortunately I was able to give my wife a bunch of pointers prior to the dive.  My weight belt kept coming loose.  For a non-diver that would have been a problem.  Pulling the raft with the air tank was bothersome.  Again, for a non-diver that would have been a problem.  In other video I saw before the trip, the dive master pulled the raft.  All in all, the SNUBA experience was great.  As for the park, I didn't like seeing the dolphins penned up.  The park itself is beautiful and there is a lot to do and see.  Everything costs more than it should but it is a tourist attraction and Cozumel lives off of tourism.  I would definitely recommend Chankanaab park if your looking to fill half a day.

{"id": 933, "text": "I went with four other people to Six Flags Saint Louis on 10/11/2008, so I thought I would take a few minutes to jot down my park review. Our group consisted of myself, my brother-in-law, my niece  >54u201D, my oldest kid 53u201D, and my middle child 48u201D. I left the wife and youngest child at home because my wife only likes true theme parks, and there is very little for my daughter u003c 42u201D to do at a typical Six Flags park.Let me just state right off that I already had low expectations for this excursion, but was hopeful that some of the changes being made at other SF parks had made it to SFSTL. The results were a mixed bag. I will start with the positive stuff and work backwards to the negative.THE GOODEvel Knievelthis brand new GCI wooden coaster is excellent. While short and compact, Evel is relentless and fun. We rode it several times during the visit, and everyone agreed it was the best ride in the park. This coaster rivals The Raven at Holiday World, but is not on par with The Voyage also at HW, which remains the best wooden coaster I have ever ridden. Still, a great ride, one that made the whole day a worthwhile excursion.The Ninjathis custom-built Vekoma MK-1200 was a lot of fun. Sure, you have to brace yourself before the jarring turns or risk breaking your neck, but I love loops, and the Ninja sports three of them. Short, fast, and fun, this was my second favorite ride of the day.Batman The Ridea typical B&M inverted coaster which is a good thing!, this ride is not as good as the Patriot at Worlds of Fun or Alpengeist at Busch Gardens Europe, but it is a fun ride, and worth several visits.THE MEDIOCREMr. Freezea Premier Rides launched coaster that loops and climbs, then does it all in reverse. 55 seconds of adrenalin rush. It is a fun ride, but short and filled with unrealized potential. It is better than a Boomerang, but still just a variation on that all-too-short theme.The Bossa CCI wooden coaster that is long and fast. It is also old, jerky, and painful. It is worth a visit, but keep your Doan's Back Ache medicine handy.Tony Hawk's Big Spina typical Gerstlauer Spinning Coaster with a slight twist: instead of a picture at the end of the ride, this coaster sports an on-ride video camera that captures your entire trip and can be purchased once completed.  The ride itself is fun, but standard.Screamin' Eaglean old school wooden coaster that races through the terrain quickly and painfully. The ride is so old and unkempt that most adult riders will require an appointment with a chiropractor after a single ride.  Please note: this is the only coaster that is not a Flashpass attraction, so the waits can be long during the peak touring times of a busy day.River King Mine Trainthe oldest coaster in the park is an Arrow runaway mine train. While boring during the day, this steel coaster comes alive at night when the drop through the tunnel becomes a pitch-black descent. This mine train ride is simple, mediocre fun for the whole family.XcaliburThis Bussink Evolution ride is a pretty intense midway experience. However, it is not a Flashpass attraction and the line moves slower than any midway line I have ever experienced. At five minutes per cycle load, ride, unload, this ride will suck the life out of your amusement park visit. Honestly, on a busy day, if you have Flashpass, ride this attraction first thing, and then ride your Flashpass attractions. Xcalibur is worth a ride, but not if the wait is more than about 10 minutes.FlashpassI purchased a basic Flashpass for the whole party for $95 bucks. I know it was a lot of dough, but since our park tickets were free, it seemed like a good trade off. Additionally, the park was insanely crowded the day we visited and without some sort of fastpass system, we would have been miserable with waiting. In fact, due to less than stellar loading and unloading practices, I consider Flashpass completely necessary at SFSTL, and somewhat nice, if you can foot the bill. It is not a replacement for Disney's free fastpass system, but it is no more expensive than what is offered at Universal. The big problem with Flashpass at SFSTL is that there are just a handful of attractions in the system. On the other hand, there are only a handful of attractions worth riding at SFSTL, so it evens out, I guess. Moreover, it is fun laughing at the plebeians waiting in line while you take their seat in the front row.The StaffFor the most part, SFSTL employees were decent folk. Some were very energetic and outgoing, some less so, but for the most part our experience with the park staff was a positive one. I dropped the staff into the mediocre category because many of the ride operators Mr. Freeze and Batman especially were oblivious to the height requirements on their rides. Myson rode Mr. Freeze 54u201D requirement without question, and could have ridden Batman 54u201D requirement but I did not want to take too many chances. Furthermore, myson could have ridden Mr. Freeze as well, but I tried to be a somewhat responsible parent. No one was checking. SFSTL needs to be careful. Don't they have enough lawsuits pending right now?THE BADMidway Attractions - After the coasters, there is not much else to do at SFSTL. The park is filled with basic midway experiences and carnival rides. As I stated in my Adventureland review, I generally regard midway rides with the kind of contempt most people reserve for socially transmitted diseases, so I was not very happy with the ride selection once I completed my coaster tour.Kiddie AreaThe kiddie section of the park was quite obviously an afterthought. Situated along a short, windy path, Bugs Bunny National Park is not really a section at all, just a series of mall food court caliber rides sandwiched between Britannia and Gateway to the West. I left my 5-year-old daughter at home for a reason: there is almost nothing for the undercrowd to do at SFSTL.Insect ProblemNot sure if there is anything SFSTL can do about this, but they have a major problem with wasps and bees at this park. Xcalibur, the River King Mine Train, and all the little roadside sugar stands were the biggest offenders. At the roadside stands, big white buckets with red syrup at the bottom were used to attract the pests away from the buyers/sellers, but I am thinking some other form of repellent can be used. Maybe not. Either way, dodging wasps while careening down a steep drop is not the kind of intense fun I am after!THE UGLYThe Whole ParkSFSTL was without a doubt the ugliest, dirtiest amusement park I have ever visited. There were weeds growing everywhere. Even the grounds around the brand new Evel Knievel coaster were sprouting weeds. Mr. Freeze sits in an area of the park that should be called Weed Island. In the line for the Boss, you walk past a roof covered with years and years of gum that litter-prone visitors have spit out as if marking their territory. There was trash everywhere, except in the trashcans.  Every ride, building, and sign needed a fresh coat of paint. All the decorations were washed out and bland from the lack of maintenance and upkeep. The areas around the bathrooms reeked of urine. The rides themselves with the exception of the new coaster were in dire need of upkeep. For those rides that had indoor queue areas, cobwebs were the featured theme. The park walkways were congested and cramped. Rides were placed willy-nilly with no thought to aesthetics or theme. Tony Hawk, The Boss, and the pay-extra Go Carts are in Britannia. Batman and the Joker are nowhere near DC Comics Plaza yet, Scooby-Doo sits right in the middle of that area. The Ninja is in the Studio Backlot. Evel Knievel is listed on the park map as being part of the 1904 World's Fair section which makes no sense, but honestly, it is part of DC Comics plaza which also makes no sense. There is no rhyme or reason to SFSTL, no theme, no thought for ride placement, they just stick a ride where there isoften where there is no room. Worst of all, no one working at the park seems to care. The entire time I was there, I only saw one employee with a broom and dustpan, and she was not sweeping, just walking. The only thing that would indicate that the mgmt team even recognizes there is a problem is the fact that every employee sports a bright green/yellow T-Shirt that boldly states,keep the park clean. My family comes here too!u201D I am sorry to say it, but SFSTL is the trash bin of the theme park universe.Halloween AdditionsSFSTL is a pathetic park for Halloween fun. There is one Haunted House and it costs and extra $5 if you want to visit. There is also a Haunted Hayride and a Haunted Train ride, both underwhelming at best. There were a few Halloween shows, but I did not take time to visit. The one Halloween parade I saw was so short I missed half of it when I had to blink to get the weed pollen out of my eyes. The only thing scary about SFSTL is the tragic lack of upkeep and attention to theme.RestaurantsI did not eat at SFSTL. In fact, I would not eat at SFSTL. The park restaurants were all disasters. In every case, the restaurants looked like McDonald's after a Saturday lunch rushbut without the one frantic worker trying to keep things clean. Specifically, in the Villains Cafe, not one table in the restaurant was clean. Same thing at Panda Express. Prices too were out of control, even for an amusement park - $50 for a Papa John's pizza, bread sticks, and a side salad. We left the park to eat at a local Steak n Shake. Not great, but $35 fed five of us, including dessert and tip. Not a lot of better options in Eureka, MO, but almost anything is better then the dining options in the park. Abysmal.CONCLUSIONI hate to end my report on such a down note, because overall we had a decent time on the rides we visited coasters, mainly. However, I would not visit SFSTL again unless there was some new addition like Evel Knievel this season that prompted the excursion. After visiting SFSTL, my appreciation for my local park, World's of Fun, has grown, and my love of Disney, Universal, and Busch with their attention to detail, theming, and cleanliness has reached lunatic proportion.SFSTL, as I have stated many times before, is a pit. Nevertheless, underneath all that garbage are a few fun rides. With some TLC, elbow grease, and a fistful of cash, SFSTL can be saved. There is a decent park under all that trash. Six Flags mgmt just needs to find it, spruce it up, and make it lovable again. It will take some doing, but it can be done.Otherwise, sell off the good rides, and close the place down.", "meta": {"review_id": "g44350-d107816-r21621660", "category": "time_of_day"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2650, 2681, "Exclusion"], [5863, 5920, "Exclusion"], [7124, 7166, "Exclusion"], [9330, 9360, "Exclusion"]]}

{"id": 939, "text": "We went during the Great Victorian Show and the kids had fun on the Victorian amusements and we all loved the Cossack horse show! Osbourne house itself is beautiful, of course and very interesting. Felt a little claustrophobic in Victoria's private rooms, but most of the rooms are big and airy. Staff are on hand to answer your questions about anything inside. There's a lift, I believe, for anyone who can't handle too many stairs. The gardens and fountains, surrounding the house are wonderful and the walk down to the beach is long but pleasant. Loved Victoria's beach There is a cafe where you can buy sandwiches and ice cream, but it's very busy and expensive, so might be better to take a picnic. The walk from the beach to Swiss Cottage is very pretty, but uphill all the way. There are mini buses to take you to various places if it's too much for you. Loved seeing the house, where the children played, but the cafe was a bit rubbish and the lady running it, was kind of rude Hence only 4 stars. Such a shame they don't have a decent tea room, with proper cups and enough places to sit. On the whole, we loved our visit. Amazing to see how lovely their lives were in comparison to the squalor my ancestors in the East End of London would have experienced. Spent almost 2 days here. Joined English Heritage, as we knew we would be back again and we were going to see Carisbrooke Castle as well, so it worked out cheaper that way. My only advice, would be to get there on time for opening, because the car park is a bit small and not at all organised by anyone.", "meta": {"review_id": "g2337531-d216115-r680317007", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[198, 226, "Exclusion"], [633, 665, "Exclusion"]]}

{"id": 946, "text": "Since there are so many reviews already about Grouse mountain I wanted tot leave a review about their so calledexpress passthat they promote. The main benefit is that it's supposed to allow you to cut in front of the line so you can be the first at the gondola and lift chair. You also get 20% discounts at their souvenir store and food credit. The cost is MORE than the cost of the mountain tickets at $69 per adult upgrade on top of the $59 ticket. I purchased it because we only had a few hours to spare and wanted to make the most of our time. Unfortunately the staff st the park appear not to know about thispassu201D. Concrete examples:Upper lift chair. There is no separate lane for express  pass holders. When you tell the staff that you hold an express pass they don't try to help you to the front of the line. They just scan your ticket and let you wait in line like everyone else. Gondola:  on the ride down. There were alot of people so I was hoping the express pass would come in handy. We got there a few minutes before the gondola came up. The staff said that the platform was full so they asked me to wait for the next gondola. I was going to say that I thought the purpose of the express pass was to allow you to get on the gondola first before the others However I didn't say anything. I waited about 8 minutes  for the next gondola. Unfortunately the staff forgot about me and started letting the other people in the regular line enter the platform. When I waived my arm to get their attention we were finally allowed on to the platform. By that time plenty of people were already on the platform.FYI :You are not allowed on the the gondola first which is what we thought we were paying for.    The express pass only allows you to be on the platform first and after that it's every person for themselves as you are squished in the gondola at maximum capacity. If you are not in the platform first you might get the worst spot on the gondola. The point of this review Is to say that if you are not getting anything significant for the express lane pass. If the management and staff were educated about the program it might be a different story. I personally felt we were up sold on something without management trying to enforce the program. It's like paying for business class on an airline only to find out that the only thing you are getting are warm nuts and hand towels but nothing else really significant. You wished you paid for the basic ticketAnd spent your money elsewhere. We had a good time on grouse mountain. Nothing against the rest of the experience. I would even recommend it for other families howbwver I would tell them to definitely pass on the express pass upgrade option. It's only an express pass on wasting your money.", "meta": {"review_id": "g181717-d156264-r693950815", "category": "age"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2585, 2629, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 976, "text": "This review is based on our recent experience on a 7 day cruise on the Norwegian Sun from Vancouver BC and return to Vancouver.The American passport control took us two hours. American citizen were able to go straight to the passport control while other nationality had to sit and wait. Once through the cruise check in was quick. we were issued with a key card for entry into our room and to used when you pay for items on the cruise. Once on board we had to find out own room. We had an inside stateroom which had a small bathroom which had a shower about 75cm in diameter, a toilet and small wash basin. Plenty of room to stow your clothes etc. Our daughter had a fold out sofa which she found had to sleep on until she pulled the mattress down from the top bunk. No room between the beds however. The room was clean and well maintained. There was a choice of two formal  dining room and two buffet dining rooms. Meals were good and you had a reasonable choice of meals. If you wanted to have a better quality meal you had to pay and go to another dining area. The entertainment on board the boat varied a great deal. The Sun band and dances were very good other acts were so so. Each day you were given a daily program which listed the activities for the day. Some of the activities were pilates, bingo, family games and  dance classes. Any activity that you had to pay for you had to add an extra 15% service charge onto the price. All prices were in US dollars.  Drink prices ranged from $5.95 to $8.85 for beer, cocktails $9.95 and an average bottle of wine was around $37.There were a wide selection of shore excursions which you could book on the ship. An excursion to look around a town was around $70 while a helicopter flight to a glacier was $734. A tour of the cruise ship looking at how laundry, galley etc would set you back around $76.The towns we visited were all relying on the tourist trade from the cruise ships and that basically had the same items to sell. A lot of the stores were owned by the cruise company.For us the exchange rates for our currency was very low. This  meant that we had to weigh up the cost against what we wanted to purchase. Most times the cost was not justified.If you had unlimited funds then you would enjoy the cruise more so than what we did. Also it should be noted that you are charged a service fee of  $13.25 per day by the cruise company.", "meta": {"review_id": "g28923-d144468-r316200526", "category": "age"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[801, 819, "Inclusion"], [916, 972, "Inclusion"], [2389, 2392, "Nothing"]]}

{"id": 982, "text": "Havasu falls and camp ground should be 5 stars always.  I would ignore all the negative reviews for one.  These people should have stayed home since their reviews are not accurate and there is no pleasing these type of people.  First off, you should try and understand the culture.  The Havasupai Indians are poor and forced to live in a canyon with only two ways to get in, by trail or helicopter.  They are also fortunate enough to have a beautiful place to attract tourist to support the tribe.   Their supplies come in by horse and mule trains, some by helicopter, but mostly by horse or mule trains.  Every tourist must pass through their community.  That is thousands of people a year that they tolerate.  I found the people very friendly and humble.  In fact, when my wife and I entered Supai an old man came up and shook my wife hand and welcomed us to their town.  Some don't want to be bother which is fine with me.  There days I don't want to be bother.  When we left the camp ground to hike out we arrived at Supai about 6:40 AM.  We wanted to stop and get coffee at the local store. The store didn't open until 7AM, but the man who ran the store saw us outside and invited us in.  He just made coffee and offer us some.  The coffee was 16 oz. and cost $1.75, very reasonable.  He had his two week old granddaughter in his arms.  Gorgeous baby.  We spoke with him for about 15 minutes and had a very interesting conversation about the tribe and their ways.  A true gentlemen.  I also saw the dead burnt horses on the trail.  Tell me what else they could do if a horse breaks a leg.  They don't have the resources to get the animal out.  It is custom to burn the animal out of respect so predators don't eat the carcass.   Also, I saw the horses in town that were skinny.  There is a reason why.  They get fed, but not like the horses that hull in the supplies.  These aren't working horses and have no value to the tribe anymore, so it takes away from the tribes resources.  I wanted to start this review defending the tribe since some of the reviews slam them. Not the case with us. This place is not a resort so don't expect to be pamper, just enjoy the peacefulness and beauty of the area and leave your cell phones and watches in the car.  My wife and I enjoyed the hike in, but started at 9AM which was a mistake.  We couldn't imagine anyway else to get there, only by foot. The switch backs are soft dirt and rock.  If you look at the rocks you can see the scuff marks where the horses slip.  When you see the scares and cuts on the legs of the horses you'll understand why.  The canyon is an old creek bad with gravel.  Some areas are soft red dirt.  Take the time to enjoy the scenery, truly god's country, so pick up your trash.  The red walls of the canyon are gorgeous.  You have to wonder why some rocks haven't fallen off the cliffs.   When you come across your first spring you have about four miles to go to reach Supai.  Once you get to Supai the ground is soft sand and it will be that way to the camp ground.  Make sure you stop at the first store and say hi.  The check in is about half way through the town. You will walk through their neighborhood the majority of the way so don't be an idiot.  The campground is two miles further. The campsites are first come, first served.  The site is about 2/3 of a mile.  There is a spring coming out of a cliff about 1/3 the way in. The water is not contaminated so we didn't treat it.  We camped right next to the creek with a picnic table and a place to set up our hammock and random dogs from time to time. The dogs are friendly and they don't beg.  They just lie there until you're done eating, then move on to another sight.  Paradise.  We went to Mooney and Havasui falls the next day.  The temperature was in the mid 90's.  I'd never seen water so blue and milky.   We spent most of our day at Havasui falls jumping off the rocks and bathe in the shallow pools. The water temp must have been in the mid 60's.  Make sure to bring river shoes.  Some people jumped off the cliff behind the falls.  One guy got lucky after he jumped from behind the water fall and was pushed underneath the falls for a while before resurfacing.  We also hiked up a cliff to a cave, which was awesome.  We found some bear dung so we didn't stay very long.  In the afternoon we floated down the creek.  If you want to freshen up use the creek with biodegradable soap, its fine. Also I wanted to mention that my wife and I felt safe the whole time there and everyone at the campground was very friendly.  We left the next morning at 5:30 AM.  The moon was out which made it easier to see and it was much cooler than if we left later. We made it back to the parking lot at about 11AM after we stopped at Supai for around an hour.  We made three mistakes.  First, we hiked in too late in the day.  Second, our back packs were too heavy.  My weighed over 70lbs and my wife was over 50lbs.  We rented a horse to take back our packs.  Cost was $95 and you get 4 packs weighing up to 130 lbs.  You must pay when you check in and have your packs at the entrance to the campground by 7AM.  Third, make sure you bring a mattress pad, because not all sites have soft sand.  Also, I fill the car up with gas at Kingsman, AZ and didn't have to get gas until Williams, Az.  We also stayed at Peach Springs the night before we hike in.  Indian Road 18 is about 4 miles from Peach springs.  I hope you find this review helpful, because I've found a lot of the other reviews on Havasui falls helpful for planning this trip.  We will definitely come back but probably will hike through the Grand Canyon to get there.", "meta": {"review_id": "g31371-d109442-r180624280", "category": "time_of_day"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[5652, 5655, "Nothing"]]}

{"id": 988, "text": "To avoid confusion, Barton Springs Pool is the name given to the part of the creek that has been turned into an official, outdoor pool with lifeguards. It's free during the winter months, after 6 and early in the morning check the website for times and the precise definition of winter months, otherwise three dollars for residents and eight for non-residents. There are lockers in the changing rooms, but you need to bring your own lock. Make sure to check the website before making a trip just in case the pool is closed for cleaning and maintenance which, being this big and a natural habitat for rare salamanders, they have to do relatively often. For non-drivers, the 30 bus goes stops on the main road nearby - just ask the driver to shout your stop. Onto the review. The pool is massive, and the best thing is it retains natural features - the rocks, seaweed, fish in the shallow end, ducks swimming about. It really is unique. The views over downtown are stunning, and especially when there's a full moon. Try to catch it for sunset - you won't be disappointed. A lot of people seemed to find it cold, but I suspect it's what you're used to. The only outdoor swimming I did as a kid was in the North Sea, so this is positively tropical for me. Topless bathing is allowed, nudism isn't. This always strikes me as somewhat odd, since it seems slightly pointless to maintain that the top half of the human body should be accepted as normal and no big deal and the bottom is something to be concealed. Still, I have a very European mentality regarding the virtues of nudism and I don't think it necessarily translates. There are grassy embankments for laying out your towels, and these tend to fill up at the predictable times - weekends, afternoons. Go in the early morning or towards close and you can sometimes have the pool almost to yourself. If you get bored of swimming and lying around, take a walk up one of the trails - there are some beautiful spots where you can paddle and appreciate the cliffs and the forests. The office should be able to point you in the right direction.", "meta": {"review_id": "g30196-d116421-r466166607", "category": "price"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2078, 2089, "Nothing"]]}

I have done experiences at Africa Alive, Banham Zoo, Woburn Safari, Folly Farm, London Sealife centre, and a handful of smaller zoos and wildlife parks. Although all have been wonderful, Colchester Zoo went above and beyond when it came to making my sons day and experience one to remember. On this occasion, he was a shadow keeper with the Orangutans, and it was awe inspiring for him to be so near such amazingly powerful, yet graceful creatures. The time given to him to fully enjoy his experience, and to ask as much as he wanted about the Orangutans was fantastic and the keeper herself was brilliant and clearly passionate about her animals. Moreover, the staff at the experience reception were also so kind, enthusiastic, helpful and friendly. The zoo as a whole is beautifully kept and the animals have fantastic, spacious and clean enclosures. They constantly promote conservation, education and clearly work hard to support species the world over. On the day we went, it was freezing and snowing, and I honestly thought it would prove hard to experience the zoo, both for ourselves walking round, and as I assumed the animals would be keeping warm and out of sight quite rightly! However, the zoo was such a fantastic place we soon forgot the cold, and actually walked for five hours before we even noticed so much time had passed! The animals have fantastic indoor as well as outdoor enclosures, so although not many were braving the cold, we were able to still see the large majority of the species there, in fact probably more than on hot days when I know from experience animals can find ingenious ways to hide from visitors eyes within their enclosures! The food prices were on a par with other attractions similar to the zoo, and the quality was excellent with generous portions, everything very hot, well cooked, and tasty. The gift bag and discount in the shop given as a gift after the experience was wonderful, and my son did not stop running to me and telling me excitedly that this was the best day out ever! Which for a snowy day at the zoo told me everything I needed to know. Will absolutely be visiting again, and 100% will be doing more animal experiences there.

Salmon, prawns, mussels, every kind of fish u can think about, salads, chilli con carne, stir fry, chicken portions, spag bol, spare ribs, chicken nuggets, onion rings, chips, soup, beautiful bread, sushi, then there was the desert section, with puddings, fruit, cheese/biscuits and fill your own ice cream cones and far far more.We were so full after dinner we didnt have room for a drink, so we sat in the bar and listened to a male solo singer  but i found him to be very rude, we clapped at the end of his song, but he said he would hang himself during his break, he was trying to be funny at times, but to be honest i coulsnt understand half of what he was saying, we went to another bar during his break !!!!!!!!!! we were woken at 8 after the best sleep i have had for a long time, we were in a 2 bed cabin with seaview, so comfortable, but a bit noisy from the engines, thank goodness for ear plugs.we arrived in Amsterdam at about half 11, did a 1 hour boat trip and had a good explore, back on the the 1st bus at 3,The queues at check in were horrendous, hundreds of French school kids, very excited and very noisy, stood in the queue for a while, then realised i already had my boarding card, so walked straight past and back onto the boat.We were booked into the 7 seas restaraunt again, and was just as satisfied with the food as on night one.After another great nights sleep, we arrived at North shields, our trip was over, disembarking took about an hour. Although there were hundreds of kids, they were well mannered and well behaved and once i shut my cabin door, i didnt hear a thing.Will definately do this trip again.", "meta": {"review_id": "g667546-d4742027-r471570000", "category": "price"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[169, 185, "Inclusion"], [486, 537, "Exclusion"], [737, 754, "Exclusion"], [767, 796, "Inclusion"], [1931, 1969, "Exclusion"]]}

I will side-step the morals as to how it got there.I did go up to the terrace got guidance from my new BFF about which lift to use. The views were AMAZING. The only negatives were a too many people up there posing, b the large art piece in the middle get rid of it and put some chairs and tables there - people want a break and c thewine terrible - it was a vin pays d'oc and myself coming from that area i thought 'thank god a decent wine at last' and it was terrible.

Lights, music, hysterical! The hotel seems like a great place with lots going on & very interactive for kids - and that was just the lobby & open downstairs areas!!! The floors are themed, pirates & adventures think Indiana Jones. Definitely recommend staying here if you have little ones - say 11ish & under, or if they're a big Legos fan. Might not be overly fun or enticing for bigger kids.  Same with the park. Lots of rides for different age brackets, but mostly the park will appeal to younger children I think. Lots of interactive opportunities, photo opps, shopping & eating/snacking. Games, rides, & ultra impressive things EVERY where built of Legos! Not too many clothing souvenir options & limited stock - so if you like it, buy it. They offer package pickup which is awesome, so you don't have to carry anything around. I enjoyed the MiniLand most - replicas of NY, LA, Las Vegas, DC, etc, & Star Wars lands/planets. Just amazing! The rides are fun, there are character photo opps, & the food was even surprisingly good for amusement park food, it's not Disney - less choices, high prices, but it works for the day. Hot & sunny, but lots of trees, & shaded areas. Parking is $18 on top of admission, but that's everywhere in CA. Stumbled onto a buffet for salad, pizza & pasta lunch - pricey, but very good. Fresh, & lots of appealing choices, even for kids. Everyone, everywhere in the park was friendly, helpful & nice - quite refreshing & unexpected at the end of summer.

{"id": 1094, "text": "My sister in law got a deal on wowcher for 6 of us to stay at Port Lympne we stayed at Bear Lodge and had access to the Reserve during our stay. Its normal zoo admission prices if youre just visiting. It was raining heavily when we came on a Monday - largely quiet to be fair - the rain didnt bother us we were dressed for the occasion. Now, let me be clear this is a reserve, its not a normal Zoo. There is hundreds of acres to be seen and walked through. We went and saw the house didnt go in theres a gorgeous view to see there but the rain, mist and fog meant we couldnt see it clearly but i imagined it was beautiful. We walked around the tigers and wolves first, i am such an animal lover - i know what people say about these types of animals but unlike the Safari we went on the evening before where the giraffes canter around wherever they fancy these poor tigers paced up and down up and down the whole time we watched them. Its probably no doubt safer for them here but they just looked sad and stressed. The cheetahs were much the same and whenever they hear a truck they associate it with food and when the food doesnt come they literally just look at the fence. They house a number of monkeys at the reserve too which were very cute. The gorillas had a new addition to the family and it was on show for us to see which was lovely. We walked miles and miles when we were there. We stopped for a coffee before heading to the dino walk - coffees were hit and miss. Dino walk was good nice addition to the park great for kids and informative for all ages. I was then ready to go so me and my partner left our party as i was feeling unwell and we left with our map. This 'map' is not a map at all its useless. We were asking people how to get back to the car park and nobody knew, literally. We looked at the map and walked towards the rhinos and i kid you not that walk nearly killed me and was hands down the worst thing ive ever experienced in my life. My partner and I are able bodied, young and healthy. I say this because i genuinely dont know how anyone could do that walk any other way. There was nobody around, no staff, no 'rangers' no trucks, no other visitors, nobody. All i could see was fields and rhinos and cages that held no animals. The walk was very, very steep. And i began to feel hot, worried and anxious - i didnt know where i was or how i was going to get out. I felt very claustrophobic and i experienced my first ever what can only be described as, a panic attack. I nearly fainted, i couldnt breathe properly my vision went blurry and there was nobody in sight to help. My partner had no idea what to do and there wasnt a soul around. How terrible is that? We also had no signal, so how on earth do you expect people to navigate round this reserve it took us over an hour due to my episode to navigate off that 'walkway' and then another 15minutes to our car. This was an awful experience for me and sadly the lasting impression of this is terrible because thats what i remember from my trip. I am wanting to warn others about my experience, and make sure you are happy about potentially getting lost and having nobody to help you, there are hills, lots of walking probably not great for buggies or the elderly either.

The crowds detracted from my experience because it was difficult to get close enough to some of the exhibits to read or interact with them.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I had hoped there might be some special exhibit for Prince's 60th birthday as of June 7.  Not only did I not see any special exhibit, but I didn't see a single Prince item. I also didn't see anything related to Bob Dylan my companion's favorite.  There was a considerable portion of the 2nd floor dedicated to Alan Freed I understand and appreciate his contribution to Rock and Roll, but it seems like an awful lot of space dedicated to a radio DJ.The layout is both very cool and very non-fluid.  It's cool because as you ascend the floors, you can look down and see each floor below, bathed in sunlight.   The layout, once you enter each exhibit area, is not very fluid and almost claustrophobic with the crowds.   There were areas on Floor 0 where were weren't sure if we had already gone that way or not.   In order to get out of the exhibit areas, you have to go back the same way you entered, which is annoying when it's packed shoulder-to-shoulder with people entering and exiting at the same time. As you descend from the 3rd floor to the 2nd, the escalator conveniently takes you directly to the gift shop.  This was not a surprise, but it WAS annoying on account of the crowds.  It appeared that the exhibits were organized somewhat chronologically, but it seems like it would make more sense to organize by genre.  I spent a lot of time looking for some Michael Jackson and James Brown stuff, and eventually found some MJ jackets and four jumpsuits from James Brown, but hoped for something more awe-inspiring.  These items were located near the Metallica nostalgia, which was...surprising.This is definitely a must-see venue and overall, I'm glad we went, but I don't feel like I need to go again.

{"id": 1112, "text": "My wife and I attended this tourist site in October 2018 and where I ran into pick pockets.It happened at the Drassanes subway station, at the foot of the walk.  My wife and I had walked all the way down to the marina area.  Very crowded with thousands of tourists.  Instead of dealing with the crowds in heading back, we decided to take the subway, and got on the Drassanes station.  The station was also hot and crowded as we waited our turn to get onto the subway.My wife got on first and walked to the center of the car.  I followed, but got held up after entering, as there were a crowd of people at the door blocking my way.There was one man in front of me in a suit... very smartly dressed... modern haircut... and another man beside me... also in a suit... looking away.I asked the guy in front if I could pass, as I was trying to get to where my wife was... but he just ignored me.  I was getting frustrated and for some reason, looked down at my feet.That's when I noticed a hand in my right front pocket.  It was the hand of the second man... looking away from me... but trying to pick pocket me.  I had my glasses and some receipts in that pocket.I didn't feel his hand in my pocket... but when I saw it, I pushed him away and started yelling at him. I made a big commotion accusing him of trying to pick pocket me.   He looked very embarrassed and denied it.  The first man then stepped around me towards the door and also denied that his partner in crime had done anything.  I noticed that the first man's arm had multiple parallel cut marks that had healed all the way up to his elbow... as he held the railing... waiting for the subway to stop and the doors to open.  Everyone was looking at them.  When the doors opened at the next station, they ran off into the crowd.Lessons Learned.1. Don't keep in money in your pockets, even your front pockets.2. Be wary of crowds, as that's where they'll strike.3. Pick pockets work in teams.  Looking back, I saw that the first man had blocked my way, while the second man, up against me... and looking away from me, had his hand in my pocket.4. You won't feel the hand.  I didn't.  Just by chance I looked down at my feet, maybe trying to steady myself as the trained moved.5. Pick pockets dress nicely.  I didn't expect suits and modern haircuts.6. Make a scene... let everyone in the area know what happened and to see who they are.My 2 assailants were well dressed, modern haircuts, olive complexion... I'd say in their twenties... slight beard growth.

{"id": 1117, "text": "I had been to the Louvre a couple of times before. Last time was almost 10 years ago. I had an awesome experience before, the museum has everything you can possible imagine including many, many monuments France shouldn't have, but never mind. Since then, apparently they decided that just too many people wanted to only see the Monalisa, so they came up with the idea to make the visit as confusing and ludicrous as possible. So now you have dozens of increasingly frustrated tourists going up and down stairs looking for a single picture. I was visiting with my 70 years old mother her first time in Paris, a present for her 70th birthday from me and my brother. We wanted to see many things at the museum, but since she has bad knees we were very aware we couldn't possibly visit it all. She wanted also to see the Gioconda, of course, but not just that. It would become a nightmare soon enough. By the time we saw everything else we wanted to see, it just became a hunting game for that freaking painting. Three times we were intentionally miss directed by the museum staff, twice taking us back on our steps, and once up a floor and to the building's opposite wing. The painting was, according to the map they provide, supposed to be on the 1st floor which is he 3rd floor up from the entry level, just to make it more poprostreous in room 711 or so.... once you get there and only then you learn it's actually been moved to room 800, on the 2nd floor and on the other wing of the building which you can only access by going up and down a half dozen stairs. Once you get there And only then. Even after asking around many employees for directions you learn that the room only has access from the entry level. I'm not embarrassed to say I lost it then, as I was done playing ball and being polite and I asked them to go f***k themselves. I don't care if you have many visitors, I don't care if you have a three blooks line to watch one painting. If that were the case it would be up to each one to actually do the line or not. This childish decoy game at some point we went up a set of stairs because there was a sign pointing up.... to find a sign pointing down at the other end is simply insulting. Not to mention the distress and fisical discomfort my mother had to endure because of they shocking dishonesty. If someone is looking to sue them for fraud please feel free to get in touch, I'll be happy to join you. This is not your every day incompetece: this is malicious and deliberate. It's simple the stupid idea that this way people spreads around. It's obscenely patronizing and dishonest. My mother was exhausted and upset, and we didn't deserved to be treated that way. It completely ruined our day and could very easily ruined our entire trip had we not just decide not to allow that to happen and get the hell out of there.On top of that, the minute we stepped out the museum we discovered we were robbed over 300 euros pick pocketed inside the museum.

The big disappointment came when we went out to check out the seats. We did indeed have a full view on the entire pitch. However, the seats are directly under the 3rd ring, which means that it is impossible to have a view of the entire stadium. One can only see the spectators below on their own side, but nothing else. Other than being a claustrophobic experience, one basically can see about 10% of the entire stadium excluding the pitch, which is fully visible. In short, a total waste of a lot of money.

As coasters are more my forte, though, I want to focus on them.

{"id": 1160, "text": "Viking River Cruise 2018Lyon to Provence + 3-day Paris post cruise extensionOur names are Lynn and Sandy Dostal and we have just finished our 4th Viking River Cruise with great disappointment.   Although we had many good experiences with Viking in the past, we feel that we really need to let others know that this cruise proved to us that customer loyalty means nothing to Viking.  1  One of the first issues was rodents in our hotel in Paris.  I use to sit up late at night only to find mice keeping my company in the lounge and lobby.  I asked the concierge if Viking was aware of all the mice and he said, u201CYes, we told Viking we can't control them because they come in from the street.u201D   Be aware fellow travelers, the hotel is the Marriott Paris Opera Hotel on Haussmann in Paris.  2  When I needed to make sure that I had a wheelchair reserved for the airport, I went to the Viking info desk in the hotel.  It was Friday evening at 4:45 and I learned that my rep had left early for the day.  I didn't think that would be a problem since there was another Viking rep in the desk next to Arneau's.  But unfortunately for me and my husband, she said that we were Arneau's clients and because we were not on her list, she couldn't help us.  She suggested that we seek the assistance of the concierge.  Sadly, the concierge had left for dinner and no help was available.  So my husband and I decided that we would just hope that things would fall into place in the morning.  3  Early on, it looked like things would work out in our favor.  Our Viking chauffer  showed up on time and we were taken to the airport and met by another Viking rep who was very pleasant.  Her name was Mason and she escorted us into the airport and sat us down.  She said she had others to meet and would be back in about 30 minutes to see that we were given assistance to the gate.  So we waited 30 minutes, 60 minutes, and almost 90 minutes without any sight of her.  My husband went to the airport information desk and explained the situation.  The attendant checked and told us that all Viking employees had gone for the day and their desk was closed.  So the young lady who met us, literally put us in chairs and left us there and went home.  We were lost, since the info desk said it was too late to order a wheelchair and etc.  What a disaster!  It took me and my husband a couple of hours, but we finally made our way to the gate without assistance from Viking.  4 I might have known that this trip was not off to a good start.  It seems that our booking rep, Beno, sent my cousin's paperwork who lives in North Carolina to our friend Miss Heidi Mihelich in Omaha, Nebraska -------  no attention to detail here!  Fortunately, Miss Mihelich immediately saw the error and sent everything to North Carolina to our cousin, Mrs. Donna Tatnall.5  And while I'm at it, let me just mention that Viking ships have trouble making it through the channels in the Elbe, and when you take a Rhine Cruise, they fail to tell you up front that you need at least one year in advance to get tickets to Anne Frank's house and the Master's Museum in Amsterdam.  They know full well that most people book that extension in Amsterdam for precisely those purposes.  Over all, we were very disappointed in our recent trip.  Not only was it our 4th trip with Viking, it was our second taking 4 other guests with us.  And this who experience reminds me of a tv commercial on downstairs bathrooms --------   I love you, Viking, but sometimes you stink!Regards,The Dostals", "meta": {"review_id": "g1939161-d10813724-r603038924", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[3534, 3539, "Nothing"]]}

Unless you are from Iceland I guess.Was my first both cold water dive and dry suit dive. But it went quiet well for a rookie i'd say. Had some problems with mobility and buoyancy, but that is probably from lack of experience.My guide, which I had all for myself, which was pretty cool as there was a really relaxed vibe because he only had to instruct me.Quick thing. There is some kind of fly living out by the lack. It doesn't bite or anything... Well it didn't bite me at least. But it will swarm you and be very annoying. Just a little heads up for you.If you are a diver find a tour and see Silfra for yourself.

There are fewer than a half a dozen instructors in the world for this course, and two are currently with Scuba Iceland. They informed me I was the first Volcano diver to qualify in the northern hemisphere.In planning my diving trip, they responded to my emails and questions with quiet, efficient courtesy. They did not ask for full payment all up front, or even a deposit which I would have been happy to provide. It was easy to tell from the emails that they knew their cold water diving, and diving generally and so it was not a surprise they provided a high quality service from start to finish. This was the six country I have dived in. More 'commercial' dive centres might take a few short cuts or have practices that are not entirely customer friendly. This simply was not the case with Scuba Iceland.The hotel pickup was timely, and introductions were pleasant. We then covered most of the training materials at the dive shop, in the quiet upstairs room, using a mixtures of slides, reading and general discussion. I had a bundle of questions to then think about before, during and after the dives. Although there had been heavy overnight snow, we lost no time on the roads to the dive site, arriving early enough to catching a rosy dawn over the flats and before the mass of snorkellers.The briefing, safety steps and dive plan were as expected - thorough without being overly long and not so short as to be carelessly dismissive. As using a dry suit and the effects of very cold water were not new to me, and so I had time to appreciate the two dives. I was kindly provided a camera to take my own pictures, and these came to me via a dropbox later that week.I would suggest you do any diving towards the end of your trip. At least for me - and I like the cold - the rest New Year fireworks, Northern Lights and the Blue Lagoon was a bit of an anticlimax.", "meta": {"review_id": "g189970-d1648193-r359059358", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1989, 1993, "Nothing"]]}

The map that you get at the Information booth is beyond useless. It gives you the impression that, for example, Level 1 i.e. the 2nd floor for us North Americans is a flat floor and all you need to do is navigate through the hallways to get from one room to another. Absolutely nothing could be further from the truth. In dozens of places, you have to navigate down or up stairs, to another level...there's rooms down there...then up again to get back to the level you think you might be on. It was beyond frustrating, and doubly so because there's an acute shortage of signs everywhere. Even getting out of the place proved to be a challenge. Seeing the Mona Lisa was a bucket list item for me. Well yes, I got to see it, but it wasn't very exciting. We followed a long lineup, snaking through room after room. Then it was up several escalators. BUT...instead of getting off one escalator and making a quick turn to get on the next one, they make you turn the opposite way, follow a route completely around the circumference of the room, and then get on the next escalator 5 feet away from where you got off the previous one! So you walk 200+ feet rather than 5. That's just dumb.After entering and going directly to the Mona Lisa, we wanted to see the Egyptian Antiquities.

I understand that activities had been laid on for the half term holiday and whilst this doesn't interest me unless I have my children in tow at least it broke the monotony of bare, redecorated cell after bare, redecorated cell. Video projections of clean, nourished actors regaling tales of prison life are all well and good for giving cold information, but I feel leaving at least a couple of cells in their original condition would have given a clearer 'feeling' and been a better educator for how squalid and miserable life in these places could be. One cell recreated with flea, grime and wear free hammocks perfectly made up for the next 'guest' are not a realistic portrayal.

I didn't want to deal with the crowds, and chose the shoulder season that coincided with my spring break, as I am a teacher. We went the first week in April, which ended up ideal. My husband and I splurged on staying at the Belmond Sanctuary Lodge for two nights-- the only hotel at the citadel itself. That gave us a tremendous advantage of staging our time at the site. We arrived from the Sacred Valley midday where we spent four days acclimating and had no issues with crowds on the bus up because of our timing. We prearranged a guide with our hotel, and met Javier at 1:00, who was amazing. The sun was shining and our experience was optimal. Crowds were minimal, and by 3:00, we practically had the place to ourselves with perfect lighting for pictures-- and no other visitors to be seen in our shots. We stayed until closing, and even the viscachas a sort of squirrel/rabbit animal came out amongst the ruins. We had purchased entry tickets for both the first and second shift the next day, which began with a rainy morning and cloudy day. We were able to wait out the rain and the lines in the early morning, entered when it cleared up, hiked to the Sun Gate Puerta del Sol in the cool clouds, and by the second entry shift the clouds had lifted and we spent many great hours wandering and snapping photos. Truly a mystical place. We left early the next morning for Cusco. Again, no bus crowds down the mountain because we were traveling opposite the crowds. In fact, we were the only people on the bus. My planning allowed us to take advantage of the change in weather and avoid the crowds at a time when we spoke to other travelers who waited in long lines and saw a crowded venue-- traveling within the same days as we did. Also, being the end of rainy season, the mountains were lush, wild flowers were blooming everywhere, with springs flowing and waterfalls full.

The condos were perfect for our families, 2 baths, one room had a queen the other had 2 full beds, gas fireplace in the common room, porch , small kitchen and dining room table.  We cooked our meals in the condo and watched the winter Olympics during lunch breaks and after dinner.   We never had to use the car except for beer runs.

At the end of the day, you can ski down a trail to the condo or take the cabriolet down.  The condo had a sauna which was out of operation, a weight room and an outdoor hot tub open at 1 pm but shut down on our 3rd day  for some unknown reason.

We took advantage of this every morning and the groomed runs were beautiful.  Ice skating rentals are free and tubing at night is free for the resort guests so these activities were fun for the kids who still had steam after dinner.Last but not least , the conditions of the trails were very good and they do a good job of snowmaking.  .  The black diamonds generally were steep groomed runs which probably would have been more difficult if there was more natural snow or icy.  All the runs are long and the chairs are fast so you can get a full day of skiing in by lunch.  There are actually 2 mountains, north and south so you never get bored.  The treed runs were a challenge", "meta": {"review_id": "g182183-d185146-r56601942", "category": "crowd"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1565, 1603, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 1291, "text": "Why does this zoo have 4.5 on tripadvisor I don't get it. We traveled 2 hours to come here from down south - we usually go to Whipsnade or Woburn. Certain things you'd expect from such a highly rated place for families, like water fountains, facilities for children little toilets and sinks, Sea Lion show, a bit of common sense etc. First thing that struck me was the weird layout of this place. If you're gunna build a zoo on a steep hill, don't further inconvenience buggy-pushers by placing winding, narrow paths as the only means of getting around. Every time we tried to get anywhere we were stuck in a traffic jam of buggys. As well as the narrow paths, the whole place is so claustrophobic and cramped, there are no open spaces. Everywhere is lined with tall bamboo and overgrown foliage so feels like you're in a maze - it's really difficult to navigate. I know they have the whole yellow line on the floor thing but even that is confusing. The dotted lines that veer off don't lead back to the main trail. Second thing was, we wanted to see the 'Sea Lion Encounter' expecting there to be seats and a Sea Lion show but it was just a Sea Lion feeding and we couldn't even see anything because it was busy. I'm not being a diva just don't give a zoo a five star review if there's no Sea Lion show? Also the toilets, why are they so tiny! Only 3 cubicles and only room for 1 small person in each cubicle.. then no child sinks for them to wash their hands. Mentioned this before but there's no water fountains, how am I supposed to fill up my water bottle? Can't carry my 2 litres round with me. Other zoos have them dotted all over. Most of the enclosures weren't toddler friendly at all, I constantly had to lift mine up to see, why can't they just have a little ledge or step for little ones to stand on to see the animals? Another thing I don't get is why they don't tell you what restaurants are where on the map. Say we wanted pizza... It just has a symbol of a knife and fork.. we followed it and found a patisserie, we go to the next one: hot dogs. What's wrong with just putting a number key on the map and listing which restaurant is where? And the train, I don't get it! I just don't understand the train. First things first, it isn't a 'train ride' - that's where you get to go round the park and see the animals from different angles and enjoy the scenery. This is just transport to the lemur walk through. You que for half an hour, get on the train, go slowly through overgrown bamboo where the instructor tells you what's on the other side of it even though you can't see through it, then you get off, walk through the lemurs for only 5 minutes while the trains waits for you then back again. Why can't the lemur walk through just be accessible to everyone and the train ride be a train ride?! I can't get my mind round it. On a more serious note, I was gravely concerned about the size of some of the enclosures compared to other zoos. The saddest were the two Condor birds inside a cage where they could barely fly a few metres each way. The African animals were all cooped up together in a small field and tbh all the enclosures seemed a little on the small side.Lastly, their first aid response was shocking. My nephew got hit in the face by a swing in the playground, his tooth went through his lip and he was heavily bleeding out his mouth. I left him with my mum and ran off to the nearest staff member for an ice pack. She said 'ask him', I go to the next guy, he says 'ask guest services', I go to guest services, they say 'I'll get someone to come over to you, are you in the playground?' I said yes and went back. Nobody turned up. I couldn't help wondering how 'the playground' was sufficient enough to direct the first aiders in my direction so they were probably wondering the playground looking for us all the while. Finally the bleeding stopped and he was ok, but we still never received that ice pack.The zoo is ok, we spent a full day here. There is lots to do. But it is the worst of all the zoos I've been to.

{"id": 1361, "text": "In late May 2019, we took our first, ever river cruise with Viking, and it was awesome. For our annual vacation we booked a Viking River Cruise on the Danube River in Europe, and it was aboard the beautiful Viking Prestige. It was AWESOME. We highly recommend it. We saw 5 countries in 8 days and never repacked a suitcase and were super-spoiled by the crew. THE SHIP AND CREW- It was super clean, and every single crew member we met was friendly. From the housekeeping staff to the wait staff, front desk folks, etc. The cruise director, Boris had a great sense of humor and did and amazing job keeping people informed. Each night he gave a 15 minute overview of the next day's events. Several of the crew remembered our names pretty quickly, and that surprised me on a ship of 180 guests. COVERED EVERYTHING - The crew prepared everyone for land excursions. They gave out bottled water at each landing point. Made umbrellas available to everyone it did rain several days, and handed out labeled cards with a number and letter, to correspond with the buses at ports to take people to their excursions of choice. VERY, VERY ORGANIZED.FOOD - The food was fantastic!!! There were two menus for lunch and dinners. One menu was standard fare served every day. The other menu was regional favorites of the countries were were visiting... the food included starters, main course and desserts. ALL of it was delicious.- and the wine flowed continuously!  Meals were all included.CABINS: There were three floors of cabins. The bottom  deck had small portholes just above the water line. We were on the second deck with a sliding glass window, that provided a great view of the river banks and we opened the window to get fresh, cool air inside from time to time it was always in the 40s or 50s at night and ranged from the upper 50s to the upper 60s during the days. The third deck had the same room configuration.The beds were large, and although some thought they were uncomfortable, we slept well. Even the pillows were comfortable. They did have two twin sized comforters on top of the king-sized bed, so each of us had our own great for couples of whom one steals the covers.  There was a closet in each room with blankets and life jackets.BATHROOMS -    The bathroom was small but practical, although with rounded shower doors that opened in 2 pieces it was hard to figure how to get into it but eventually we did. They ALWAYS had hot water which I thought was amazing.TELEVISION and WIFI INTERNET- Yes, they had TV if you needed it. CNN, History Channel BBC news and a couple of others, but we didn't watch it. Internet was decent, although as expected on any moving vehicle it could be spotty, but  we did enjoy Netflix shows at night, so it wasn't that bad!TOP DECK - If it were warmer, it would have been a nice place to get sun, but it was cool or wet for the entire trip. There is a walking track, so we did use that, and we went up there to enjoy some of the riverbank sites.EXTRA SPECIAL LENGTHS TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE - The Danube was experiencing flooding, and some of the river walks in Passau, Germany were even under water when we got their by bus. The Captain and Crew were Especially cognizant of the flooding , and for safety reasons, we docked 20 miles south of Passau, Germany and they arranged Buses to take us there for the excursion. When we saw the flooding, we were so grateful for VIKING'S Safety procedures. They also had assessed that with the river flooding, we would not have made it under the bridge to get the ship into the Passau port.. OVERALL IMPRESSION - Fantastic Vacation. Best crew EVER, great FOOD, Excellent EXCURSIONS, Great Tour guides, Comfortable rooms, 5 countries in 8 days.", "meta": {"review_id": "g274887-d298971-r678866128", "category": "crowd"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[378, 396, "Inclusion"], [1141, 1163, "Inclusion"], [1386, 1410, "Inclusion"], [1421, 1445, "Inclusion"], [3620, 3630, "Inclusion"]]}

That was really cute.We sat there for a couple of hours and when the sun goes down and the breeze picks up it gets very chilly so wrap up warm and take a rug or fleece with you. One of the cutest souvenirs I found was a penguin wearing a sweater.  The money from the sale of said penguins funds people who knit these sweaters. The sweaters are used to keep penguins warm if their plumage is soiled by an oil leak, for example.

Once you exit the boat, there is a charter bus waiting to take you to the dock where the catamaran is docked.  Our boats happened to be docked within walking distance so some of our group elected to walk back to the cruise boat afterwards.We had a 4 person crew for our trip driver, one at snack bar, and two about the boat to answer questions, and help spot wildlife.  There were only about 30 of us on the trip, so we were very comfortable and there was plenty of room to spread out both down and upstairs.  When the boat is packed, it would have been more difficult for those sitting in the inside seats to view the wildlife.  After a quick safety demonstration, we headed out.  It takes just under 2 hours to reach the beginning of the Tracy arm.    Once there the captain slows down dramatically and you begin to see small icebergs.  We were fortunate to have great weather: partially cloudy with a few moments of sunshine, no rain.  We saw a few whales, bears from afar ravens, eagles.  No otters unfortunately.  The captain will stop the boat for photo ops.  The highlight of the trip is the Sawyer glacier.   Your captain take you to either the north or south end depending on the ice condition; we visited the north end.  After that the boat heads back to Juneau.  Our excursion included a sack lunch sandwich, chips, granola bar, water.  Coffee, tea, and hot chocolate were available for free the entire ride.  They passed out a few free samples chocolate, smoked salmon, spruce tip jelly and there are other snacks available for purchase.  Tracy arm is beautiful, but our cruise happened to sail through Glacier Bay National Park, which in my opinion, is far superior for viewing purposes.  Unless you specifically wish to see Tracy arm or have limited mobility, I would not recommend this tour for your time in Juneau.  On a previous trip we hiked the Mendenhall glacier area and now having experienced both, I much prefer the hike.   It was a bit overkill for our active family to spend 7 hours on boat ride to Tracy arm and a whole day at sea viewing Glacier Bay.  For that reason, and because of the costs, I would not do this tour again.  For reasons unknown, Allen Marine was not ready to receive us at our ticketed time.  Our bus driver was forced to kill over and hour with us randomly driving up and down the Main Street.   There was no explanation or apology from Allen Marine once we were finally able to board.

They never made anyone feel rushed.  The views from this floor are great, there were a few items for sale....t-shirts, travel mugs..... but wait for the gift shop down stairs.  Elevator down is quick again, and of course the exit is through a gift shop.  They have a large selection of items.  There is a small snack area. Now, here's the dilemma.....  some days the place is packed, lines are long, wait is long.  How much time do YOU personally want to invest?  Depending on your previous travel this may or may not give you the wow factor. If this is your first opportunity to see something like this then you will be wowed and you should go.

We toured from the lowest level, which details the beginnings of the Atlantic slave trade, and spirals upwards three levels, concluding with the inauguration of Obama oh how I miss him...but I digress. SECOND : there are no exits and no bathrooms while working your way through history, so pace yourself. THIRD: the food in theis wonderful, not to be missed, but be forewarned, it is pricey.

{"id": 1449, "text": "My wife and I just returned from our first cruise. It was a 10 Eastern Caribbean out of Port Liberty in Bayonne, NJ and included stops in Haiti, Puerto Rico, St Thomas and St Maarten. As I had done extensive online research and pre-planning for our trip I held no great hopes for it to be anything more than a chance to stretch our legs after three days at sea. I was not mistaken.We had reserved floating beach mats in advance, but were unable to use the. The water was so rough that we could not even stand up alone to get on the mats. If we went in the water the waves would immediately throw us back on shore. No one was swimming at all so we just sat on the mats and drank the rum punch that was available at a shop there.After a couple of hours a man came along and told us that if we walked a short distance to the other side of the narrow promontory we were on, that we would find it easier to swim. We took his advice and sure enough, there were thousands of people jammed together there. It was calmer, but such close quarters that the floating mats were worthless there as well. We abandoned them on the beach as had many others and just bobbed around in the sea of humanity there.The attractions normally available such as the zip line and Dragons Breath, were closed due to high winds. Even beach combing is forbidden there, with signs posted all around warning you to stay off the coral and not take any souvenirs.Lunch was complimentary and served in the style of a company picnic. Nothing was particularly notable with most being either bland or overcooked or both.Overall I had a good time, because I was warm and fuzzy with my rum punches inside and my sweetie by my side. It was much better than shoveling snow off our roof back home.If planning a similar cruise and can avoid Labadee or any of the other private islands, I encourage you to do so unless you just are looking for an expensive rest stop.", "meta": {"review_id": "g147306-d150230-r188353565", "category": "price"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1535, 1580, "Exclusion"], [1901, 1920, "Exclusion"], [955, 996, "Exclusion"]]}

We got there before our tour. The kids and hubby took advantage of being able to hold game used bats by professional baseball players. Hank Aaron, Baby Ruth, and Yelich were the big joys for us there were other areas with players bats and information about the type of bats and such on display. There was info on the history of ball and the old Negro Leagues which is cool because my son is learning about that in school now, and women's in baseball and more. You were able to see players quotes and more. There were people nearby to answer questions. The guys in the area where you could hold the game used bats were the best. When the younger gentleman found out about my sons project on Hank Aaron, we was all chatty and showing my son information. It made him that much more excited for his project. The tour starts with learning about the trees and goes through the whole process of making a bat. We were able to see machines and such in action which was great  Watching it all was cool and their methods for painting and customizing are pretty awesome too! The tour ends with you being able to take a mini bat home. My boys loved that. The only negative for me was being unable to take any photos during the tour. They don't allow it.

{"id": 1461, "text": "Always on my bucket list and it did not disappoint.  I got tickets 3 moths in advance...don't wait for both the day and night tour since we were in Granada for 6 nights.   We did the day tour first and were very glad we planned it this way.  Don't fret what time of day to pick as the tickets are limited and the Alhambra is quite large.  Cabs to the Alhambra are roughly 5 Euros.  Feel free to take the bus but cabs are plentiful and easy. They also know based on your Nasrid Palace entrance time where to drop you off there is more than one entranceLike others say, be at the Nasrid Palace before your appointed time.  Don't miss it as it is amazing.   Make sure to get a ticket for this.  What others don't say is this: Don't overthink this visit.  You are given a map but you won't even need this.  After entering you walk up a hill and follow the signs.  The signs take you on a very logical route thru the gardens and buildings. They are very well marked.  It is very easy to get to the Nasrid palace and it is very well marked. We would recommend getting to the Alhambra 1-1/2 to 2 hours prior to your Nasrid Palace entrance time.  This will give you plenty of time to see the gardens and outer buildings, tower etc before lining up for the Nasrid Palace.  The gardens are actually part of the whole Alhambra.  Not what I expected since you go thru other buildings with fantastic views as well as the gardens see photos.  It isn't that the gardens are separate and just gardens.  They are integrated into the whole Alhambra complex and a big part of what you want to see.  The Tower is also worth the climb. You will need to show your ticket so don't misplace it. Fun to see all of Grenada from the top. Also interesting to see the Nasrid Palace and layout of the Alhambra.  However, if you are crunched for time, this is what I would skip before the gardens and Nasrid Palace.  The Carlos V Palace building will take you about 10-15 minutes to see if you don't go to the museum.   If really short on time, this can be skipped first.  Now you line up for the Palace.  Very well marked.  Just make sure you get in the correct line.  One is for tour groups and one for individuals.  The Nasrid Palace is indeed a former palace. The tile work is breathtaking, the views are amazing, the rooms are splendid.  I was quite glad that tickets are limited and timed.  Although, during the day it is crowded, it wasn't claustrophobic crowded.  Simply amazing.  Each rooms and courtyard was more beautiful than the last.  Do not miss this! Our night visit was so completely different.  First off, they barely sell any tickets for this.  Second, most tour groups have left Granada. Third, it is eerily quiet.   We were first in line which we highly recommend.  We arrived about 45 minutes early we didn't know how much time to budget-taking a cab dropped us off 100 feet from the palace/also lots of cabs waiting after timed exit is over.  This means no one is in front of you as you go through the Palace.  This means no one is in your photos, blocking your view, or being noisy.   Having been at the Palace during the day, we knew to go quickly through the first rooms and get to the magnificent rooms with tile work and the courtyards.   Again, most of the tourists will be taking time in those first rooms so no one will be with you on your tour.  Rooms that had hundreds of people in during the day, were beautifully lit and empty.  Ahhhh.   Not all the rooms that are open during the day are open at night.  You won't miss them.   The quiet and the beauty of the night, and the views, and the lighting will be more than enough.  Friends asked if we had to pick one way to see the Alhambra which would be pick?   We would have to say during the day.  However, if you are there during the night you will be enchanted.  We thought it would be too much to see it twice but were so very glad we purchased both tickets.", "meta": {"review_id": "g187441-d191078-r627459102", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[2376, 2404, "Exclusion"], [2406, 2438, "Inclusion"], [3910, 3914, "Nothing"]]}

You queue for an hour to be on the ride for 2 minutes where the hand movements have no correlation to where you shoot very disappointing. All the major rides have queues of over an hour for standard users yet priority passes at ridiculous prices enable you to jump straight to the front. Most of the kiosks were shut so the queues for the remaining ones were massive, half of those were card only and this wad only advertised at the counter. The food was cold, over cooked, visually unappealing and served by people that looked no older than 15 most off them with no management around to monitor the poor attitude and lack off urgency. Facilities such as toilet again had queues,  were tired dirty and smelly. We waited in the rain for the pirate show for half an hour in the rain on the Saturday and an hour on the Sunday to be told last minute that it had been cancelled, no explanation just that it was cancelled and the next show may be on. This was an hour and a half wasted we could have spent QUEUEUING for one of the few rides that was open. The Lego village looked very tired and looked like it all needed a good clean.

{"id": 1496, "text": "Located right on Duval Street in Key West's touristy parts, for me, The Key West Butterfly and Nature Conservatory was a heart palpitation waiting to happen! Not that it's horridly scary there- on the contrary. Everything is so stunningly beautiful and serene that you're scared to move so that you don't ruin anything. As long as you don't fall into any pens or touch butterfly wings just don't try to touch anything, really you should be ok. I went with my husband and family, including my niece Penelope who was just shy of one year old and had already visited it more times than I. While waiting to get in you're surrounded with metal butterflies and frogs, local art and sculptures. Some would call it a gift shop, but it was really cool to see so many different styles, it felt like a museum of modern tropical art. But, not as lame as I made it sound just now. Inside is a magical menagerie.  Your eyes are trying to take it all in but your ears may immediately be assaulted by Scarlett and Rhett, the local flamingos. They're beautifully weird, not the same shaped birds as I'm used to seeing in our local Detroit conservation Zoo. These flamingos are more like fancy fat-butted question marks who like to get really REALLY close to you then scream in your face. It was really funny, actually but some kids did cry. I did not. They were either in heat Rhett or just arguing with one another because it seemed like a stay on your side type of situation from Scarlett's POV. I think they're definitely the stars here, and I really believe they know it to be true. It's a self guided tour, so you're free to spend as much or as little time as you'd like. But it does get crowded, especially if there's something nice to see like Rhett following you or a butterfly being, well, a cute butterfly on a leaf. It's pretty zen-like. All of the butterflies are free-flying, so you're sure to get some really good and also some really blurred photographs. They swoop in and out, all around, it's like living in a Disney cartoon at it's most magical moments. Aside from the panic that a beautiful butterfly could possibly be near where you might put your foot down and die, it's really calming. There's no obtuse music playing to make the atmosphere seem more comfortable, no piped in floral scents to really get the mood. It's an honest to goodness natural calm that only something so beautiful can achieve. We took a rest in some butterfly shaped benches for our cliche tourist photographs, had some fun with Penny and all of the exotic wings of various insects and birds-and one teenage girl in a costume. I'm sure that's hella common. The flowers are amazing, colors like you won't believe and the birds are magnificent. There were some hatchlings scampering about during our time inside and I think I probably spent most of my time watching them roll around with Penny, who tried to catch one. Don't do that. They don't like it when you do that. I'm trying to figure out how to re-download my video of the little bird puffs so if I finally nail that then I will repost. Everyone who lives in these domed walls carries on like they can't be bothered by you. They have their banana slices and sugar water, their lettuce leaves and oranges. They live the life of luxury we all pretend to do whilst on vacation, only they're better at it. This is their world and they graciously let us in. At only $12 admission BNC one of the more inexpensive spots on the island. The money is put to good use right back into the Conservation of the animals and artists, and the gallery work of Sam Trophia is a must see! You will not see anything else like it, plus you can buy some of it, too, and will not regret it. But, be advised, some of it is SO fragile, so plan accordingly because chances are if it breaks you will not find another one exactly. The staff here is incredible with humans and animals alike, knowledgeable and happy to help. The Gallery is really neat and provides some good gifting ideas should you be in the market. Also, the Learning Center is good for a quick educational stop which introduces you to the types of butterflies around the world, their care and even some caterpillars getting started in their new lives . There is even a live feed webcam on the site so you can spy on some scenes if you miss them while back home. Or, you know, people watch. But it's mostly kids shoving through and people taking photos of things that you're also looking at. Still cool. I know what you're thinking- Katie, you went a bit ago and since then a giant hurricane has hit! Is it still there? Is everyone ok? Yes and Yes. Word on the street is that people are smart and courageous heroes and the animals were taken to safety as best as possible. Rhett and Scarlett are well, last I saw a photo they were doing laundry gothamist.com. The floors needed some work but other than that you are welcomed back to the Conservatory happily!From what I see, it's a cool place for a wedding, birthday party, vacation hotspot or just a place with A/C if you're warm.

Certainly the emphasis has changed over recent years as one of the attendees remarked that she did not recall there being such a tour when she last visited 30 years ago and that the slaves had then been referred to as servants. The docent confirmed that times have changed and Jefferson was certainly guilty of double standards and was complicit in the reprehensible treatment of his slaves.Nowhere to get anything to eat at the top - they don't appear to want to encourage you to stay.

Most rides had just 1 staff member loading and exiting guests. This meant twice the wait to board and lines when none were necessary. Any family with children could be satisfied with it's large variety of rides, food and games, both permanent and temporary. However, that variety leads more to a hectic and frenetic visit. The Burlap Bag slide is fun but is clearly built for the midway at a traveling fair.  The add-on purchases inside the park such as the pony ride are set up for maximum revenue and moderate enjoyment. The stirrups aren't adjusted for small rider comfort and sense of security, the leading staff interfere with photographs by walking outside the rider and pony, as they are required by management.  A small ride offers young ones a chance to climb into a Panda Bear Black & White and circle a beehive oozing with honey.

Naturally it's small up there due to it's position in the building, but the views are spectacular.  There's a terrace on level 152, where we saw the sun set and Dubai at night come to life.

We'd booked to have a meal after the experience in the Armani Amal and was directed by a guide to the restaurant, so far so good.  The guide had informed us that we were able to go back through the attraction so that we can see the information about the building of the tower and visit the gift shop etc.  However, when we tried to do this after our meal, the receptionist at the restaurant said that we couldn't do that and as we weren't guest of the hotel we'd have to exit the hotel and walk around the street etc to get back into the Dubai Mall to visit the gift shop but we couldn't see the display/information about the building of the tower etc.  I suggest staff managing the Sundowner tour liaise with the staff at the Armani restaurants and settle this confusion.In conclusion, I would recommend, if you wish to spend on the Sundowner lounge experience, don't book a meal after at any of the Armani restaurants if you wish to have the full Burj Khalifa experience.

Street musicians play regularly on the sidewalks and performers and artists take their places outside the square perimeter on the brick roads that, while I have ridden in the family car down them, in most recent years they are only used for pedestrian traffic.  On one of our last visits, my husband and I watched  as a bride with her bridal party strolled down past the square with their parasols and their own NOLA-style jazz musicians.  And on that same day, I had to wait for a family to finish taking their photographs in front of the very statue that has reportedly offended so many.  Their color did not seem to matter, they were embracing the history of the area with their poses and smiles in front of that statue with the famous Cathedral in the background.  Since we went in the spring, the plants were vibrant and fragrant,  which only enhanced the immaculately manicured grounds. On the river side of the square are horse-drawn carriages ready to take you around the French Quarter or drop you off at theDu monde for some delicious hot beignets.", "meta": {"review_id": "g60864-d104486-r639029493", "category": "family"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1270, 1292, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 1559, "text": "This is my 6th year attending the F1 race in Abu Dhabi. It is a world class event but I noticed a number of issues which were detrimental to our enjoyment of the event this year.We brought our children age 8 and 4 for the first time during the day and attended the concerts in the evening without them. During the day, I felt that there really was not enough areas set up for the children to play in, and not enough for the kids to do at all. Given I've paid full price for a ticket for both the kids, and plenty of people bring kids, I think this needs looked at. It's also irritating that no consideration is given to people with kids who may like to have an alcoholic beverage. No kids are allowed into the drinking areas. I only wanted one drink! There's definitely a solution to this issue, can this be looked at? It's very poor in this day and age. Why could I not get any ear defenders or ear plugs? Why are there not vendors walking around with these? We lost a pair of plugs belonging to my eldest and it was ridiculous I couldn't get replacement ear plugs anywhere! Its the noisiest event when the cars are racing, and a slam dunk for sales when people need to protect their ears!  Every year there is usually a chance to get golden circle upgrades on the concert tickets. This year those opportunities were extremely hard to come by. I couldn't find anyone giving them out or for that matter anyone actually giving chances to win them. We attended 3 of the 4 concerts. The sound quality is amazing but found that there really should be more ATMs available in the concert venues. Crowd control at the entrance to Rihanna was dreadful, really really dangerous. No barriers set up outside the gates resulting in a mass congregation at the entrance  with people pushing in from all sides and causing huge tension in the existing crowd. The staff doing the searching of bags and metal detection were totally overwhelmed!!!!This is a big issue and needs looked at for next year. I was so glad I did not have my children with me, people were panicking and that's really dangerous. Huge crowds need managing better than that. The organisers are extremely lucky there wasn't a serious crush or panic situation resulting from this poor planning. Something was missing from this event this year, it's lost some of the sparkle and magic. Please bring it back!!! I heard lots of complaints from lots of people about many things!!!If you need some top notch assistance and brilliant inputs to improve this event for the spectators from an experienced project manager and a person who has first hand knowledge over the last 6 years of the event let me know, I'm available for hire. uD83DuDE09", "meta": {"review_id": "g294013-d2248659-r440504806", "category": "family"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[344, 399, "Exclusion"], [405, 441, "Exclusion"], [681, 724, "Exclusion"], [1590, 1643, "Exclusion"], [1645, 1668, "Exclusion"], [1707, 1794, "Exclusion"], [1794, 1841, "Exclusion"], [1984, 2032, "Exclusion"]]}

{"id": 1571, "text": "I just went here July 26th with two small kids.  I have many mixed feelings about this place.  First, is the price. I understand it's a theme park however,  for the size, selection of rides& cleanliness I am bit unhappy.     The tickets are overpriced.  The one perk was my little one was free.  Here's a tip: go to Weiss supermarket for discount tickets  still expensive at $34.  Parking is free for general parking.  If you get preferred parking  which you can throw a stone at from general parking is $10. Keep the extra money in your pocket & go with free parking unless, of course you have someone with a disability.  I could see it coming in handy is you have let's say a wheelchair perhaps.      Upon entering they check bags. I think that's great but it's partially I'm sure because no outside food is allowed.  The food here is overpriced and not edible more on that later. To enter you walk through a gift shop. This is clever but, make the space wider especially since this is a park for kids and therefore parents with strollers. The space is so small you bump into people.  Moving into the park the young girls at the  gate were very nice.      It was a hot day so of to the water park we went.  There were tons of families and very happy children.  It was great how they seemed to have something for all ages in this area.  We spent a few hours here and moved onto the ready of the park.  The lifeguards from what I am were really watching the small ones who were climbing up things they shouldn't have been and warned them. The smile on their face was friendly and not threatening at all to them. I especially appreciated this as i watched because toddlers can be a little emotional  when they think they're in trouble.  Shoes are to be worn however, I seen more people without them then actually wearing them.  If you go wear water shoes so you don't slip.     My toddler had a great time on the rides he was able to go on but he wanted more.  There was some thunder which closed down more then half of the park.  The entire exploration center with the dinosaurs was closed.  We watched a show since there were no rides really open. It was cute and a nice change for a little while.   If your looking to sit for a few minutes go check one out. Due to weather we decided to eat& see if the rain passed so pizza it was.   Disgusting stay away. It was old, cold, & upon really looking behind the counter after my other half already bought it it was dirty.    The price of the park made me stay in the rain not wanting to leave and then have a weather change. Later the weather did change but the entire time I asked different workers what the rules were for closing the park due to weather and not one of them knew. I would think they would've known the answer.  If there is bad weather go to the park entrance & ask about  tickets for a future date for free during the season.   Lastly,  just a quick comment on the employees.  Although the majority of the workers seem to be teenagers and young adults they seemed like they hated being there.  A smile wouldn't hurt. A big applause to the 2 girls at the gate,  & the  boys at the exploration gondola ride. They were the only people who made you feel welcome. If this park is owned by Hershey maybe they could come over and train these employees on basic customer service.", "meta": {"review_id": "g52970-d270670-r293160357", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[191, 219, "Exclusion"], [225, 251, "Exclusion"], [356, 378, "Exclusion"], [381, 416, "Inclusion"], [635, 696, "Inclusion"], [820, 862, "Exclusion"], [980, 1003, "Inclusion"], [1042, 1084, "Exclusion"], [1209, 1236, "Inclusion"], [1241, 1260, "Inclusion"], [2336, 2356, "Exclusion"], [2358, 2374, "Exclusion"]]}

In several spots around the Inner Harbor, on Pratt and Calvert streets, and other walkways going to Harbor East, sections of brick squares were either damaged or missing. These could inadvertently cause a wheel or a foot to catch in it and create a mechanical issue. 2. Cut- outs for wheeled device access - in most areas, the curb cut-outs were generous and readily available. There are a couple of spots that were tricky. Outside the hotels in the inner harbor area Redwood, Light, & Calvert street, there may have been cut-outs at the intersections, but with valet parking, unloading a scooter or powered wheelchair requires pre-planning so you aren't unloading a person into traffic lanes & then traveling to the nearest & safest cut-out.We discovered a couple of cut-outs traversing alleyways which had steep angles. We recognize the city rises from the harbor and the angles change as you go up hill. Again, not insurmountable, but noteworthy for the disabled traveler. 3. Water taxis would have been a wonderful way to move from area to area with impressive harbor scenery as a bonus. However, only a couple of the taxis had a ramp or gangway that could be used. Even the, as explained to us, the occupant had to walk onto the taxi, and then arrange for the assistive device to be manually lifted on or off. We didn't try the Charm City Circulator metro bus, but we're told it was adaptable for limited mobility persons the bus would kneel to lower the step onto the bus and for", "meta": {"review_id": "g60811-d261225-r503331840", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[677, 712, "Inclusion"], [730, 783, "Inclusion"], [1345, 1381, "Inclusion"], [1788, 1833, "Inclusion"]]}

We managed to find separate seats close by then as people departed, we moved to sit together.  I might recommend if you are traveling with family at Christmas time to get reserved seats together.  I saw many families get on and walk back and forth looking for seats.  Our favorite is the club car but that was already full when we got on at the airport.   My daughter made a friend and they ended up sitting together - which was perfect since we are 3.  The crew was nice.  We got a coffee for $2 in the club car.

{"id": 1578, "text": "I had visited this museum more than 2 dozen times over the last 15 years.  There is always a line for people without a Museum Pass. The 5th Floor Impressionist paintings is always very crowded.  The lunch hours 12pm-2pm has the shortest line and smallest crowd.  This museum needs to be visited in good daylight condition because so many rooms depend on natural light, especially the Floor 5 impressionist paintings. I had visited in the evening once and would not recommend it -- the paintings lost their vivid colors without the natural light. My knees are bad. This museums has 5 floors. I have yet to find a way to avoid stairs entirely. Over the years, I have figured out how to visit this museum with the least stair-climbing. Musee d'Orsay has well hidden elevators which I had never used because they were not located at where I need.  The museum's escalators are located at the 2 ends of the long ground floor hall lined with statutes -- the far end's escalator goes up, the opposite end near entrance goes down. The visit itinerary that would require least stair-climbing is:1 upon entering the museum, walk down 1 flight of stairs to the central long ground level hall lined with statutes. At the end of the long hall, on the left side is a tiny cafe.  Walk past the cafe and you'll find the escalator hidden behind the red wall. This escalator  goes only to Floor 5 Impressionist paintings.  2 Start the visit on Floor 5. The first thing visitor will see is the gift shop and the big clock.  Walk through the long impressionism hall brings one to a lovely restaurant. Continue past the restaurant is the escalator going down. Use this escalator to visit every floor.    There is a lavishly decorated reception hall on Floor 2 which most visitors miss if visitors follow the sign and go directly towards the Gauguin/Van Gogh room.  This is how to find this reception hall -- after getting off the escalator on Floor 2 and going in the direction of Gauguin/Van Gogh room indicated by the sign, visitors come to this intersection: going straight is the Floor 2 restaurant, turning left is the Gauguin/Van Gogh room.  If one turns RIGHT at this junction and walk 15 steps opposite direction of the Gauguin/Van Gogh room, it's the entrance of this stunning reception hall with lovely view.  The current exhibition of the black models is one of the finest and most interesting I had visited in major museums in the world.  The information on the wall, the brochures English/French, and audio guide are excellent. The art works come from museums and private collections worldwide.

We did the roundtrip from Oslo so had to catch a 6:30am train and did not get back into Oslo until almost 11:00pm. We are from Alaska, so our expectations when it comes to beautiful scenery is probably higher than most. The train ride to Myrdal was long, but there is some interesting scenery when you get up above the tree line, but nothing we hadn't seen before in Alaska. The best part of the whole day was theRailway from Myrdal down to Flam. It wasn't crowded, they had TV's with commentary, a map of route, announcements and even stopped and let us out at a waterfall to take pictures. Then we get to Flam and get on the boar to Gudvangen. The boat was not designed as a tourist boat, especially for the summers in Norway where it rains a lot. There were other groups already on the boat and since it was raining, all the seats inside or under cover were already taken. We had to go downstairs in order to get out of the cold rain and from there visibility outside is limited. Having been on fjord tours in Alaska, we were disappointed we came all this way and they didn't have a better boat that was actually designed for sightseeing! It was a 2 hour boat ride and after the first hour we were ready to get off the boat and start the long trip back to Oslo. If you have seen the fjords in Alaska, you wouldn't be missing anything by skipping these. Another notethere is limited food options throughout the day. There is no time built into the day get a bite to eat, so you are limited to what you can get on the train or boat, which is a premade sandwich or hotdog. When we finally got back on the train in Voss for our trip to Oslo, the bistro car was packed with hungry tourists who had not had a chance to eat much all day.

{"id": 1612, "text": "Confession time: when we arrived, neither of us thought we'd spend much time here. We walked around outside for a bit before deciding to drop the money on this museum. We didn't think it'd be a waste of money, but we did think that it was overpriced.WRONG! There's SO much to do and see here. This place is MASSIVE, and overflowing with content and history and experiences. My God, I want to WORK here so bad after visiting! MoPOP, if you're looking for a certified event planner, call me! =I took way too many pictures to post.We splurged with the Avengers add-on. I couldn't not. We started our visit in the gigantic room with the sky-high video screen and sat down to watch an interesting music video. From there we walked into the hallway behind us, with the musical instrument structure, the tribute to Chris Cornell and rooms leading off to exhibits on independent gaming one of my favorite spaces, Jimi Hendrix and Nirvana.Heading downstairs, we wandered into an auditorium that was showing footage of the Seahawks' first Super Bowl season - leading up to the Super Bowl and highlights of the game itself. Once that finished, we toured what was left in that hallway, then went back upstairs to the top level, where all the Marvel stuff lived.That was impressive itself - they had a lot of stuff on display that I would expect to be housed at some Disney resort or museum. There were a few photo-opportunity spots that I, of course, took advantage of and a lot of history on Stan Lee and comic books in general.After that, we wandered into a Science Fiction room, with more props and pieces of history from novels to TV to movies. From there we followed the hallway to an exhibit about horror not sure if it's up because it's October, or if it's a year-round thing. We briefly stood in line for a scream booth, but then I heard the group in the booth actually screaming their heads off, and I promptly got back out of line. I don't need that particular photo opp quite that badly.Once done with all the spooky stuff, we headed back up towards the Marvel pop-up shop. On our way there, I heard the guy on the sky-high screens in the lobby talking about Michael Jackson, so I paused. Turns out it was the intro into Thriller, so I sat down. The crowd that stopped to watch the video in full warmed my heart.Getting up from there, we continued on to the Marvel pop-up shop, and then headed to what I thought was the exit...only to find that we'd missed one more exhibit: one on fantasy! I might've been exhausted and starving by then we'd been inside for almost 5 hours by that point, but there was NO WAY I was leaving without hitting that exhibit.It was just as glorious as I hoped it'd be, with nods to everything from The Wizard of Oz to Harry Potter to The Chronicles of Narnia to The Lord of the Rings trilogy. I legit could've spent the rest of the night in there, but my husband was fading, so we headed out.On our way to the bar - I mean restaurant - we stopped by the newly-erected Chris Cornell statue. It was...interesting. Definitely not the life-like tribute I'd hoped for, but it's nice that they're paying tribute to him at all.Seriously, MoPOP - experienced and certified event planner.

I found it to be narrow as compared to some others and somewhat claustrophobic. There some water features along the way and the nice thing about that was that none encompassed the entire width of the river so if you had little kids or whatever, they were easily dodged. The thing I found weird was that it was only about 2.5 feet deep so when I was encircled by a ring expecting to float down the river, I found my knees and ankles getting scraped up! The only way was to lay on top! There are plenty of seating areas, nicely spaced and separated so you don't feel like you're in a mob. Lockers are available which were easily rented but not sure it's necessary if your in a group and someone stays behind. Snacks and food are available too at the usual Disney overinflated prices.

There are over 450 dogs, hundreds of cats, cows and water buffalo and 2 monkeys. Volunteers are introduced to the park via a film in the van ride.The guides walk you around and introduces you to the elephants and their mahoots.There  are 9 elephant families currently at the park. All are able to move freely from river to mud bath to sand to shade. The mahoots are quietly nearby but only intetfering if he senses distress in his elephant.The elephants like to bathe in the river in the afternoon at which time guest to the park can join them, in the river , gently splashing the elephants with buckets of water.Volunteers are encouraged to enter the cat kingdom and play with the cats who love the attention.I recommend an overnight stay. The park takes on a different  tone at night. Thai massage is offered on the upper deck and there  is a bar with cold beer. Without all the day park visitors it is more quiet and yet feels a little like summer camp.After checking  into your room you can be a dog walker. Heading over to the dog camp you can hear them all barking for attention. I walked a beautiful terrier mix named Clay. Many if the dogs are maimed and have injuries. The volunteers walk them with doggie wheelchairs.The second day brings more interaction with the elephants. You walk the whole park, make food and feed the older ones.All of the animals are respected and cared for. There are vets and clinics, dog and cat beds everywhere, cat tree houses, and always a dog at your feet.We were well fed during our stay and the food was fantastic.Our guides were knowledgeable  and passionate.

{"id": 1647, "text": "This is a long slog. Took us 4 hours up and 3 down the Mountain Path. Given it was June, the weather was drizzly and about 12 degrees at the bottom - freezing literally and snowing at the top. We knew there would be no visibility at the summit but we only had the one full day in Fort William so we went for it. The views for most of the way up weren't actually too bad as the clouds wisped in and out. Waterproofs and warm winter hats and ski gloves are needed in similar temperatures and obviously decent footwear - even with gloves on our fingers were pained from the cold until we'd part-descended. Even without a proper downpour, our covered day-bags still got wet so make sure bags are covered and use a liner if it's really bad weather I wish I had just in the drizzle. It was so cold we spent very little time at the top - only to take a few pics and have a nose in the buildings - absolutely astonishing that there used to be a hotel on the summit!!! Walking poles will make the descent far easier than without. Underfoot the track itself varies quite considerably with steps and a little clambering her and there a lot more clambering on the descent than you realise you've done on the ascent and then scree fields from the second half. The route is really well laid though and has quite a clear track to follow and we only went very slightly wrong once. Caution should be taken during wet weather though: my walking friend took a slide down some wet steps right near the edge of a precipice which was a horrible moment. All in all it was a good walk for those with good mobility who can manage a little clambering over rocky areas nothing too arduous by any means. We are amateur walkers and concerned about visibility, we decided to delay our planned early start-time to later when we knew there would be more walkers about. This was a good thing to do. The mountain wasn't packed by any means and we could always be certain we were following the correct route. Tips:Food: there is a decent sized M&S Foodhall a couple of miles from the Visitor Centre on the road into the northern entry into Fort William selling sandwiches etc. There is a Morrison's in the centre of Fort William next to the train and coach stationToilets: Glen Nevis Visitor Centre loos open 9-5. I drank at a steady rate and didn't need to go for the rest of the hike. There are areas you might be able to slink off if desperate but not many as it's a fairly open routeParking: A few free spaces on the lane near the Ben Nevis Inn sign posted orin the visitor's centre - make sure you have correct change with you.Last minute kit panics: There are quite a few outdoors shops in the centre of Fort William selling all the standard walking kit. Parking is free in local car parks for the first 30 mins you still need to get a ticket thoughSo would I do it again? The last and biggest of the Three Peaks, it was very hard work followed by 3 days of very achy calves which I didn't experience on Snowdon or Scafell Pike I am of reasonable fitness and run so as much as I'd really love to see the views, I feel my Ben Nevis box is ticked for the time being - on a clear day I might be tempted to journey by Gondola to view Ben from a distance in the comfort of thethough ;o", "meta": {"review_id": "g186545-d194657-r680945171", "category": "crowd"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1866, 1905, "Inclusion"], [2726, 2741, "Inclusion"]]}

{"id": 1650, "text": "When you first pull up to the Hualapai Hilltop parking lot at the end of Indian Rd 18, you can't imagine the surprise that awaits some 11 miles away and 5,500 ft. down in Havasu Canyon.  Even after hours upon hours of research and gazing upon photoshop'd pictures, you still aren't ready for what lays ahead.  The spectacle that is contained deep within these canyon walls is a stark contrast to what you would expect to see in the Arizona high-desert.  By the time you reach the junction at Hualapai and Havasu Canyons about 5 miles into the hike, the canyon walls' colors have changed from a bland tan-grey to a vibrant orange-red.  Shortly thereafter, a variety of trees and groundcover begin to cover the canyon floor, providing a bright green carpet that pleasantly contrasts/complements the canyon walls.This is about the time you begin to hear the babbling of Havasu Creek.  The creek is a sight for sore eyes after hiking about 7 miles. It means you're getting close!  And after crossing a small bridge, there is a nice spot to dip your sore feet in the cool, crystal clear water.  You begin to notice even at this point in the trip that there is something different about the water in this creek. By the time you reach the small Indian town of Supai, you are ready for a breather.  There is a small store and picnic area on the outskirts of town where we like to stop to cool down and rest our weary legs.  The store has just about anything you want to drink or snack on accept alcohol.  I don't know where they get their freshly cut fruit, but it is to die for!  Skip the sodas and junk food.  I know what happens when you mix Mountain Dew and candy bars with an 8-mile hike in the hot Arizonabelieve me, it's not good!  Tip #1: Pick up a frozen Gatorade on the trip out of theis amazing aboutof the way out when it turns into a much needed slushy!After paying and signing in at the campground office, you're only a hop, skip, and a jump from the first two out of five breathtaking waterfalls, New Navajo Falls and Rock Falls.  Navajo Falls is about a mile past Supai and, if you're not careful, you can walk right past it without even realizing it's there.  And Navajo Falls is not to be overlooked!  At some points, the water is literally bursting through the seams of the rock and vegetation like a 75 foot dam on the verge of crumbling.  At other areas, the falls trickle down the side of the cliff face.  If you accidentally pass it by, walk about aof a mile farther to Rock Falls.  As the trail turns in front of Rock Falls, you will see Navajo Falls in the distance.  Tip #2: Make your way to a great vantage point over Navajo Falls by following the sound of the creek as it gets louder.Rock Falls, at about 30 feet high, is more a run of the mill waterfall.  Don't take this the wrong way.  It is beautiful in its own right.  When compared with the other major falls along this route, however, it pales in comparison.  It does offer a striking turquoise swimming hole and I've heard that you can actually climb behind these falls.  But most people, including us, take a couple of photos and pass it by because the primary purpose of this trek is just around the bend.As you approach Havasu Falls commonly miscalled Havasupai Falls, you know you're in for a treat even before you set eyes on it.  The sound of the creek quickly graduates from a babbling brook to a thunderous roar.  And then it comes intoawe-inspiring waterfall plunging over 100 feet into a glorious pool that would make you think you were somewhere in the Caribbean!  The way the red rocks, the majestic waterfall, the green vegetation, and the turquoise pools blend is behind words.  It is easily one of the most beautiful places I've ever been!  But don't stop too long to swim in these crystalline watersu2026there's much more to see.About amile beyond Havasu Falls, you enter the campground.  The camping conditions are semi-rustic.  There are composting restrooms and port-a-potties, but no shower accommodations.  Bring bio-degradable soap and you can bathe in the stream.  There is also a well for drinking water, but we still treat it just to be safe.  The campground is situated along Havasu Creek in between Havasu Falls and Mooney Falls.  Tip #3: When you get to the campground, head toward the far end to discover beautiful sites right next to the creek.  People are usually tired when they arrive and take the best ones up front.  But there are usually great sites left in the back.After getting a good night's rest, you're ready for round two.  Depending on where you set up camp the night before, you could be amile or a few steps from the mega-impressive Mooney Falls.  This is definitely my favorite part of the hike.  Mooney Falls drops a colossal 200 feet into bluish green swimming hole below.  In order to get to the bottom, you have to make your way down the side of the cliff wall through a series of narrow tunnels, chains anchored into the rock, and makeshift ladders.  Although there is a sign at the entrance of the first tunnel that readsat your own risk,u201D I have seen young children, old folks, and every age in between climb down and back up.  The important thing is to watch your step and beware of others passing by.  Once you reach the bottom safely, you have a 360 degree view of nature at its best.  As you look up at the cliff walls that conceal this magnificent display from the rest of the world, you notice great crests that have formed along much of the perimeter, reminding you that these pristine surroundings are in a constant state of change.Tip #4: As the water flows downstream of the swimming hole at Mooney Falls, the elevation drops about another six feet to form what some people refer to as Little Mooney Falls.  If you look closely at this small waterfall, you will notice that there is a tiny cave behind the falls.  If you're not claustrophobic, take a peek.  Last year, this was the climatic conclusion to our lengthy trek into Havasu Canyon.  We knew that Beaver Falls was another long 3.5 miles downstream, but we couldn't imagine that the scenery could get any better than it was at this point.  How wrong we were!A few hundred yards beyond Mooney Falls, water trickles over an outcrop of limestone on the left side of the creek.  Underneath this protrusion, lime green ferns and other various plants swarm the cream colored walls.  This is a great place to stop for lunch, swim, and take a few great photos!As you trudge on towards Beaver Falls, the trail skips back and forth across the shallow creek.  There are countless waterfalls along the way.  At one point, the only trail clearly accessible is on the left side of the canyon.  After a short while, you'll begin to notice the winding trail being overtaken by groundcover.  And this is where the panoramic vistas shoot off the charts!  The emerald flora gets thicker and thicker until it is about five feet high on both sides of the trail and climbs half way up the sunburst face of the 200 foot high canyon wall.  Couple this with the addition of the milky-blue babbling brook below, and I can't imagine there are places on earth much prettier or more serene than this!Once you get through the massive sea of green, you will have to cut across the stream one last time.  This is the last and most strenuous section of the hike to Beaver Falls.  But you've already made it this far, so don't stop now.  Along this stretch of the trail, you'll do some moderate bouldering, easy rock climbing, and have to duck under a short palm treeu2026yes, a lone palm tree in the middle of the desert.  After scaling a 15 foot wall using a rope someone kindly left behind for future hikers, you will climb roughly a couple hundred feet up the right side of the canyon.  The landscape changes once again, this time showcasing more common desert plants and cactuses.  From this great vantage point, you first set eyes on the fabulous multi-tiered Beaver Falls!  In between each of its four drops, there are excellent swimming holes to play in.  You can even climb behind some of the falls.  After climbing back down the canyon wall, sit down, relax, have lunch, and ponder the stunning surroundings.  After all, you've earned it!Tip #5: Bring both hiking boots and water shoes for the trek between Mooney and Beaver Falls.  You will get wet and have to climb, so be prepared!  Also, bring food and plenty of water.  Even though the maps list the mileage between falls at about three miles, the hike seems about five miles because you're constantly climbing, descending, and crossing the stream.I recommend doing this trip in no less than three days, even though it's possible to hike it in two.  You just need time to relax and really absorb the surroundings to get the most out of it.  You can either pack all of your gear in and out, or you can take the easier route and rent mules to do it for you.  If you're not a backpacker or hiker, there is also the option of flying in and out by helicopter.  No matter what option you choose, Havasu Falls should be on everyone's bucket list of places to see and experience before you die!", "meta": {"review_id": "g31371-d109442-r83497168", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[9111, 9115, "Nothing"]]}

{"id": 1653, "text": "This beach is seriously off the beaten path. You have to pay a $6 toll to get across the bridge to Sanibel Island, then parking is $2/hr. It's nice because it keeps the throngs of Spring Break students off the beach! Tons and tons of shells available by beach combing. The beach was really warm in March when we were there. Ocean was a little chilly, but there were lots of people in it. Lots of people rent bikes and ride up and down the island. The island comes to a traffic standstill between 3-7PM - word to the wise. Next time, we said we'd park the car at the end of the island and ride the bike down to the beach so you don't have to be in the gridlock. One of the restaurants on the way back had a sign spinner outside with a poster that said 1 hour to the causeway, 1 minute to happy hour, turn in here. Ha!From the parking lot, you have to walk probably 1/2 a mile to the beach. There are quite a few piers to walk on, some bathroom facilities, showers, benches and a little park before you get to the beach. My husband had a boot on his foot due to an injury and could walk most of the way to the beach without a problem. For maybe 100 yards, he had to walk on sand. So, if you have someone with an injury, they could probably get out there. I wouldn't think a wheelchair could make it out all the way to the beach, though.There is a drink vending machine, but no other food or vendors on the beach. This is not the place you go parasail, jet ski and all that.  It's relatively quiet, very scenic and beautiful. People of all ages were enjoying it.

{"id": 1746, "text": "Back in October when I paid a visit to downtown Atlanta for a long weekend, I essentially devoted an entire day not that I'd spend all of it at the Georgia Aquarium. I had drowned in the countless rave TripAdvisor, Google, forum, friend reviews, and so I simply HAD to check it out. At the end of my visit, I could definitively assert the Georgia Aquarium lives up to the hype and exceeded my expectations!Adult admission is a reasonable price, not the cheapest but arguably very affordable for seeing the impressive facility. I traveled solo in my wheelchair, and there righteously weren't any accessibility concerns. The general flow of foot traffic was smooth, which was aided by the aquarium's layout: It's a massive atrium, around which lie the various exhibits Ocean Voyager and Cold Water Quest, to name aVoyager has a gigantic tank with many thousands of fish, and it's a must-see. Overall I felt like everything was conveniently in reach and enticing for me to explore with vigor. From that tank mentioned above that ranks in the top five largest on the globe, to generously-sized viewing places to watch all kinds of incredible, often-rare species, to the brilliance of the seals in the seal show, the depth of seeing and learning about animals is outstanding. I really understood the aquarium's mission to provide experiences difficult to find in a typical aquarium, striving to act as a center for research and conservation. Perhaps in other words, I LOVED all the animals I could observe and follow around with my eyes. :So to all Atlanta tourists, locals, new residents, etc etc...the Georgia Aquarium is an attraction not to be missed. I should note that while the interactivity is optimal for kids, anyone at any age can have an equally great time. Check it out!!", "meta": {"review_id": "g60898-d588792-r733664648", "category": "handicap"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[527, 559, "Inclusion"], [571, 617, "Inclusion"], [1680, 1713, "Inclusion"]]}

One of the most moving experiences for us was coming upon Henry Moore's 'Mother and Child' which, in its modernity, was so incongruous at first, but so perfect once you had a moment to pause and consider its beauty and how fitting it is. Similarly, Bill Viola's video installation, 'Mary,' was beautifully mesmerizing. What a stunning pair of artworks in this corner of the cathedral. We couldn't pull ourselves away. You must not miss this corner of the cathedral!One slightly disappointing aspect of the tour was the artwork on the ceiling which was dimly lit and hard to actually see.We also climbed the stairs to top of the dome for an extraordinary view of London which will require you to be both fit and not claustrophobic.

The Aquarium is very interesting and is well laid out, normally this type of place would be very enjoyable. The problem as to why the mixed review comes from the overall experience which unfortunately has nothing to do with the aquarium or the Ripley's people. The negativity of the experience comes from kids, kids and more kids. A place like Ripley's Aquarium has tendency to attract parents and legions o kids like ants are attracted to sugar.

Your feet are stepped on, your ankles and shins are smacked by strollers and everybody is pushing to see the displays.

We had our 2 yr old granddaughter there a few weeks ago. She didn't want to go home. Better than indoor play facilities.Our son told her the story of the Causeway that he learned when he was small.Legend has it that the giant Finn MacCool and the Scottish giant Benandonner challenged each other to a fight. So Finn built the Causeway so that he could get to Benandonner. As with all good legends there are two endings, leaving each of them the victor.When I visit these days I'm in a wheelchair, but there is a big proportion of the walk way accessible. Toilet facilities are good also.If you just want to see the stones you only pay to park your car.

So by the time we got to the market I was done, physically exhausted.   We went in the market first. I was expecting a farmers market, what I found was a lot of junk.  So I convinced the wife to exit that building and go over to the bakery. Line was really long. I told my wife standing in a 30 minute long line was out of the question for me.  So after heated words. I went back to what I call the middle where the grass and kids play.  I got a bottle of water 1.25.  I found a spot on a bench near the parking lot we walked in from knowing the wife would find me.  5 minutes later the wife walked up after having our daughter guilt trip her for chastising me for not wanting to stand in the line, she gave up on the line as it was not moving.

If you look at reviews there are none that recommend Valley of the Kings for wheelchair users, so I wanted to put that right!We went on a guided tour so our guide arranged the tickets. There is a visitor centre that you go though to enter. We noticed a queue for toilets outside, but go inside as there are more loos there. Inside there is a larger toilet cubicle, but it doesn't have any grab rails. It was clean when we went, but I imagine this isn't the case later in the day. We had to ask to use this toilet, otherwise you are directed to the standard facilities.Once through the visitor centre there is an area were you can get a ride up to the valley. This isn't wheelchair accessible, but it is only a short walk anyway so not a big issue. The surface was okay to wheel on but you may need help depending on how strong you are. Photos are allowed in the tombs now, for free, with a mobile phone with the flash off. You can pay if you want to take a camera.The standard ticket allows access to 3 tombs. I went in 3, 2 of which were also accessible in a wheelchair. I recommend going as early as you can in the day before the heat and the main tours arrive.The first accessible tomb was KV2 Rameses IV. There is a loose surface on the approach, but quite short. Once in, the tomb has step free access with a boarded surface to wheel on. I have attached a few photos.The next one we went in was KV6 Rameses IX. This has a sloped entrance of stone, with a few gaps between the slabs. Again the surface inside was boarded. The main route inside was accessible, although I think there was a separate section off the main route with a few steps.The 3rd tomb we went in wasn't accessible. There are some other wheelchair accessible tombs but the terrain to get to them needs a lot of effort. My hubby decided he was happy with the two he went into.In the tombs there are staff. They are not paid a lot so benefit from tips. They will provide information, point out areas of note one guys job seemed to be to point out the more phallic images!.

The many buffet restaurants had a ton of good choices, from fresh fruit to eggs, serano ham, etc.  The a la cart restaurants were very good, too, serving fresh high quality food.  Let me not forget the 24h Beer Garden.  Usually such places serve you some questionable burgers and fries.  Not at Pesquero.  The 24h open Beer Garden has about 10 hot and cold tapas type dishes.  At the beach, you can get really solid pizza .  The hotel itself is just a different level better than anything I've seen in Cuba.  Every detail has been thought off.  It's an open space concept so there is always fresh air.  The lobby itself is so impressive and chill.  You could easily just relax there all day long.  They serve some decent espresso.  It's a very big resort and you can pick between walking or using their frequent transfer services via golf carts and the recently introduced train on wheels.  The rooms are nice, spacious and clean.

The site is big and this means that there may be a lot of walking but pathways are well laid out and finding your way around is not hard.The attractions are varied and suit all ages but trying to pull everything into one day can be tricky so perhaps 2 days or some pre-planning is called for. Unlike many places the admission cost is not overly high but concessions, food and side shows can push the price up.Within the cost are obviously the castle walls and grounds and, great favorites, the Birds of Prey and Trebuchet shows. Indoors you can also enjoy the state rooms and their examples of period furnishings and diaplays of armour and the like.We bought the ticket for the Dungeon experience. If you suffer from claustrophobia, have difficulty with tight stairways or are/have children who are easily upset you may want to consider not doing this one. If, however, gory stuff excites you then you will have a great time.Parking near the main entrance is limited so either get there early or be prepared for a walk to one of the out-lying car parks.

The smaller cave that you go through on the way to Jacob's Ladder is great, it is cleverly done and gives you an idea of what it was like living in the caves, my children, aged eight, were a little scared by some of it and it is quite dark with small spaces which some might not like. There is an exit half way through if you don't like it. Jacob's Ladder was fun, lots of steps but plenty of places to stop and everyone was friendly and supportive. A half way point mark would be nice but it was worth climbing. At the top there is a lot of space and walks and a further thing to climb to get a better view. The steps aren't that wide so passing isn't the easiest on the steps but that's a minor gripe.There are plenty of little shops, the majority are dog friendly, you can buy some very expensive cheddar cheese that has been made in cheddar and there are a couple of really nice ice cream shops, a range of places to eat if you want. It's a nice spot and we enjoyed walking around as much as the caves etc. The drive in and out is interesting with rock faces, lots of people with their climbing gear heading up the sheer rock faces and lots of people walking up the less steep, grassy areas.

{"id": 1888, "text": "Under a glowing rock backdrop, open trams amusement park style glide visitors up to the area of the tombs.  It main part is a small attraction, that offers several tombs to visit.  They open in different rotations to help preserve the paintings and carvings, and some may be closed when you visit.  Just outside some tomb entrances are small shaded areas with rather well done diagrams, explanations of whose tomb it is, along with general layouts, when the tomb was discovered, and what the decorations are in part at least.  The colors, well preserved, are surprisingly rich and varied.  Is this setting as astonishing a place as Karnak or Luxor?  No.  But if you are a fan of the history of Tutankhamun's discovery, it is well worth seeing how bleak the area was and is, and how fortuitous it was that his tomb was actually found. Tips:*General Tickets allow a visit to 3However, Tutankhamun and Rameses VI tombs are an EXTRA fee.*There is a gift/souvenir area and restroom near the main visitors center. *There is NO photography of any sort inside the tombs. Sometimes cameras are collected at the gate. You can bring your cell phonebut there is still an official policy of NO photography.  *There are stairs or ramps down into the tombs. Some passages are long and rather steep. Be prepared if there are mobility issues. *It can get very crowded with tour groups going in all at once, and the tombs can feel a bit claustrophobic when large groups are in relatively small spaces. *It is desert, and the temperature can soar!  Be prepared. *There is limited shade, restrooms are available in a trailer after you get off the tram, and there is no food or water at the attraction itself. *King Tut's tomb is very small, and there is no treasure in it, except for the mummy himself.  That is a treasure indeed! He was such a small lad, had such a short reign, and yet he has truly fired our imagination.", "meta": {"review_id": "g294205-d321166-r539904451", "category": "claustrophobic"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1284, 1325, "Exclusion"], [1327, 1350, "Exclusion"], [1398, 1433, "Exclusion"], [1637, 1687, "Exclusion"]]}

The fee to get in is $20 per person and does not include the guide. It seemed that one is required, but there really isn't a need for one. There is a short trail to several holds with the last one having a platform to jump into the water. The entry is populated with vendors selling souvenirs, beer, shots, and pot. The water and surrounding area is littered with trash. What is a beautiful place is being ruined by bottles and bags floating in the holes, and food plates and plastic forks lying on the ground. Thirty-years ago Dunn's River Falls was like this, but it's much cleaner and organized now. Hopefully they can turn this around and save this site. When the u201Cguidedu201D portion was over less than an hour we tipped the guide $10 25%, and almost 1/2 day's pay for most Jamaicans and he said that $40-50 was a good tip and this wasn't enough. Another couple who tipped a similar amount with another guide had the same experience. Worth a trip but go with your eyes open and be careful. Dunn's River is safer, cleaner, more organized, and actually cheaper when you factor in the guide's fee. At Dunn's River the guides are clearly optional.", "meta": {"review_id": "g147312-d1997485-r733212674", "category": "price"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[422, 461, "Exclusion"], [813, 832, "Exclusion"], [1029, 1045, "Inclusion"], [1514, 1530, "Inclusion"]]}

We saw dancing santas, a nativity with real camels, sheep and more, a bus journey through the streets of New York and so much more, the show lasted one and a half hour and then, that was it!

I did not spend the whole day here, as I visited the island via cruise ship. I disembarked the ship, purchased a one-day fare pass, from the Visitor's Center at King's Wharf, for approximately 20.00. It allowed unlimited use of buses and ferries for the day. Horseshoe Bay was one of my must-see stops. The bus driver let me know when I wanted to get off and there was a short, downhill walk to the beach. For those who do not wish to walk, there is a van that will take you to the bottom of the hill, or to the top, for a fare of approximately 2.00 each way. A bargain when you are too tired to come back up! There is a small snack shop at the bottom and a place where you can rent beach items. I did not check any of these out, as I was not prepared to swim or spend much time. I took my photos and dipped my toes and was off. There is a station to wash the sand from your feet and a bathroom. I used neither. It is cheaper to just venture out on your own, taking the bus to the beach, as there is no fee to use the beach.

{"id": 1982, "text": "We visited Sesame Place on a Saturday in October. The park was not that crowded which was nice and the lines for the rides were very short. he most we waited was 10 minutes to ride the carousel. We purchased our tickets in advance and printed them at home which saved time when we arrived.  To start our day, I booked the Breakfast with Elmo. The buffet was inedible. The bagels were rock hard, the hash browns were greasy, cold, and void of flavor.  I didn't even try the eggs - they looked terrible. The french toast had no flavor and was barely cooked. Everything was probably previously frozen. For $17 per adult and $10 per child we ate cereal and yogurt and had coffee and juice. The only good part was that the characters were there and my son loved it. He had his picture taken with Elmo and for $20 we purchased the pictures. Again a total rip off but he loves Elmo. The characters did come by all of the tables to interact with the kids.  After the disgusting breakfast, we did not eat anything else at the park. We finished in the early afternoon and ate outside of the park.  If I visited again, I would ask Guest Relations where the characters would be for photo ops rather than spend money on a character breakfast. They were very gracious in helping us locate Cookie Monster which is my son's favorite character. There really are not that many rides when the water park is closed. We knew that before coming so we did see a show which was worthwhile.  There was a Halloween parade later in the day and other activities.  We took a hayride with one of the characters around the parking lot. It was cute and surprisingly it was included with the price of admission.   I do recommend getting to the shows 20 minutes early because the line grows pretty quickly.   Based on some of the reviews on here, I expected the park to be filthy however, I was pleasantly surprised about the cleanliness of the park and the bathrooms. I found the park very clean and well kept. The staff members were very courteous and helpful. I left my son's water bottle at the breakfast. They had put it aside for us so when I went back I was able to find it.  I would probably not return to the park and certainly would never pay full price.  I was also appalled that we had to pay $17 to park but we really did not have much choice.

{"id": 1983, "text": "How Universal excels is also how also its cracks are shown. This review is only for the Universal Studios US side and not Islands of Adventure IoA.Having never been to US we decided to give it a try this vacation. We had been IoA in the past and liked it enough to give the other side a go given the addition of Diagon Alley since the last time we had been to Florida. The last time we went was over 6 years ago and we had stayed onsite at Royal Pacific when there were only three hotels. However, with the addition of new hotels and renovations, Royal Pacific became outside our cost ability.  As a result this was also our first time staying off site and driving to the park which also provided a different perspective. o get our day started the GPS address listed on the website for the parking garage was incorrect and caused us to go past where we actually needed to park. The website lists the parking garage as 6000 Universal Boulevard whereas it is actually 6300 Hollywood Way on google maps. Once we pulled in for parking the upcharge selling tactic began starting with premium parking even though we were there right at 9am.Having not purchased tickets previously we had to say no multiple times to express pass upgrades, park to park passes and multiple day tickets. I feel like with the express pass system rewards those who have excess disposable income while punishes those who cannot afford an extra $100+ per person per ticket when a 1 day 1 park pass already costs $133 per an adult. It is a way of separating the wealthy from those who are not and let's be real, the cost is high even for those who are middle class. I much prefer the system Disney has set up where everyone is able to book 3 Fast Passes regardless of if they are staying on property or not and without an extra fee. It causes a more equal distribution and acknowledges that vacations to Orlando cost a lot of money and they want to make a great experience for everyone. With all the upsell tactics, it felt like US only cared about the money and not the customer experience.  Diagon Alley is a beautiful area and the reason US even has 2 stars, 1 alone is for this portion of the park. It is smartly designed and feels like you have walked into a movie set and are fully immersed in the world of Harry Potter. It really is a wonderful space to just take in all the details. On the flip side there is only one actual attraction and a large amount of food and shopping i.e. more places to spend money. I would have liked to have seen at least one more actual attraction considering IoS has three in the Hogsmeade area. While Diagon Alley is designed so strongly, it makes the rest of the park look neglected and old. If US looked like Diagon Alley throughout the park it would warrant the price, but as it stands right now it does not.Many of the IPs are older and need updating. The theming is nowhere near on par with what has been created with Harry Potter. All the buildings start to look like giant box buildings. The other issue is the number of 3D/4D movie simulators. It is the bulk of the park and after the third or fourth they get a bit boring and predictable. Many of them as disappointing overall or seem too short to even count as an actual ride. I am not someone who gets motion sickness, but if you are prone to motion sickness this is not the park for you. After about the third or fourth simulator I felt queasy which never happens to me. While there are a couple rides Men in Black and The Mummy that aren't simulators and/or have 3D glasses with them, pretty much everything in the park uses the same tactic including the ride for Harry Potter. There is a lack of imagination and innovation in the majority of the park.Staff was hit or miss as well. Having tried to figure out how to do the virtual queue for Jimmy Fallon we stopped at the attraction to ask if there was standby. We were told no we had to take a virtual place in line. I told the attendant that I had been trying from the phone but hadn't been able to figure it out on the app. He then told me that it didn't work well and to just pull it from the kiosk instead. Having been at Disney where the app does everything from food ordering to fast passes, not being able to get in line virtually seemed like an interface issue that the park needs to make stronger if they aren't going to allow for standby and to be able to compete. We had this conversation at 1:50pm, walked to the kiosk and pulled a 2pm return time to go back to the attendant and then turn over the card. It would have taken less time to go standby then it took to go down grab the ticket to return back with the paper ticket. Harry Potter and Rip Ride Rocket also both went down while we were waiting in line for them and no one could provide any time line for when it might be back online. When there are only about 10 rides in the park, having the two major rides shut down on us in one day is a bit frustrating considering the cost to be there.  As a family, we did not feel that US warranted the price they were charging for admission based on the majority of the attractions that they had in the parks. This experience cemented in my mind that US isn't a place I foresee myself returning anytime soon without an overhaul being completed to the park. PS We rode everything in the park between 9am-5pm except Rip Ride Rocket which went down when we were the next people to board. Since a time for being back up and running couldn't be provided, we decided to leave the park as everything else had been completed. This trip occurred in June with no express passes. I would not recommend the extra cost since if you are there at park opening you will have plenty of time to ride everything.", "meta": {"review_id": "g34515-d102432-r683228470", "category": "age"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[1585, 1597, "Exclusion"], [2419, 2439, "Inclusion"], [2761, 2778, "Exclusion"], [3303, 3327, "Exclusion"], [5019, 5041, "Exclusion"]]}

But I didn't know that if you don't want to take the tram, there is a back way that will take you to the water pretty fast and assuming it's been raining - which is not near the visitor center/entrance, but instead accessed beyond the parking lot the back part of the parking lot relative to how you enter. I wish I had known this before! If you don't have a long time, and you want to show people the beautiful views but also end up at or hang out in a more scenic spot quickly, this is the way to go! The water is a big hit with younger kids - great for climbing around, dropping rocks in, etc.", "meta": {"review_id": "g60950-d209268-r372496411", "category": "family"}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[75, 89, "Inclusion"], [720, 745, "Inclusion"]]}

Was surprised to discover how many people still lie entombed below the surface.

{"id": 1997, "text": "Visited the Casa Loma Legends of Horror twice this year .....it was SO GOOD!VERY well done .. not sure how this haunted house experience could ever be improved upon.  Set in a real 'haunted' castle, beautifully maintained grounds and interior .. genuinely creepy in many areas too like the tunnels and stable areas.  The props are super creative .. everything from lighting to special effects, sound effects, to the over the top decorations and costumes.  The actors playing the various ghouls are very good and entertaining.  I really liked that in the beginning you are advised that no one will touch you ..which was reassuring because let me tell you ..the well timed scares they provide are frightening enough.  But they know when to let off ..they don't chase you forever!. I also liked how you get a little break in the middle with the super cool Captain Morgan bar serving up yummy spooky cocktails along with a funky DJ.  Overall a fantastic way to spend an October evening for an hour.  Get a few friends together, get the crap scared outta you and have a blast!!!!

We were among the first into the Sistine Chapel, which meant that as we walked through other parts of the museums on our way there, we were in vast hallways alone, and could get photos without strangers in them. There's so much to see - to be able to do so without feeling pushed or claustrophobic because the hordes of crowds are all around you allowed us to enjoy our visit.
